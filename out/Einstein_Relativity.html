The  work  presumes  a </p><p>standard  of  education  corresponding  to  that  of  a </p><p>university  matriculation  examination,  and,  de-</p><p>spite  the  shortness  of  the  book,  a  fair  amount </p><p>of  patience  and  force  of  will  on  the  part  of  the </p><p>reader.  The  author  has  spared  himself  no  pains </p><p>in his endeavour to present the main ideas in the </p><p>simplest  and  most  intelligible  form,  and  on  the </p><p></p><p>1 The  mathematical  fundaments  of  the  special  theory  of  rela-</p><p>tivity  are  to  be  found  in  the  original  papers  of  H.  A.  Lorentz,  A. </p><p>Einstein,  H.  Minkowski,*  published  under  the  title  Das  Relativitäts- </p><p>prinzip (The Principle of Relativity) in B. G.

The  general  theory  of  relativity,  together  with  the </p><p>necessary  parts  of  the  theory  of  invariants,  is  dealt  with  in  the </p><p>author’s  book  Die  Grundlagen  der  allgemeinen  Relativitätstheorie </p><p>(The  Foundations  of  the  General  Theory  of  Relativity) — Joh. </p><p>Ambr.

I  adhered  scrupulously </p><p>precept  of  that  brilliant  theoretical  physicist, </p><p>L.

I  make  no  pretence  of  having  with-</p><p>held  from  the  reader  difficulties  which  are  in-</p><p>herent  to  the  subject.  On  the  other  hand,  I  have </p><p>purposely  treated  the  empirical  physical  founda-</p><p>tions  of  the  theory  in  a  “step-motherly”  fashion, </p><p>so  that  readers  unfamiliar  with  physics  may  not </p><p>feel like the wanderer who was unable to see the </p><p>forest  for  trees.

EINSTEIN </p><p></p><p>NOTE  TO  THE  THIRD  EDITION </p><p></p><p>I </p><p></p><p>N  the  present  year  (1918)  an  excellent  and </p><p>  detailed  manual  on  the  general  theory  of </p><p>  relativity,  written  by  H.  Weyl,  was  pub-</p><p>lished  by  the  firm  Julius  Springer  (Berlin).  This </p><p>book,  entitled  Raum — Zeit — Materie  (Space —</p><p>Time — Matter),  may  be  warmly  recommended </p><p>to mathematicians and physicists. </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>BIOGRAPHICAL  NOTE </p><p></p><p>A </p><p></p><p>LBERT  EINSTEIN  is the son of  German-</p><p>  Jewish  parents.  He  was  born  in  1879  in </p><p>  the town of Ulm, Würtemberg, Germany. </p><p>His  schooldays  were  spent  in  Munich,  where  he </p><p>attended the  Gymnasium until  his sixteenth  year. </p><p>After leaving school at Munich, he accompanied his </p><p>parents to Milan, whence he proceeded to Switzer-</p><p>land six months later to continue his studies.  </p><p></p><p>From  1896  to  1900  Albert  Einstein  studied </p><p>mathematics  and  physics  at  the  Technical  High </p><p>School  in  Zurich,  as  he  intended  becoming  a </p><p>secondary  school  (Gymnasium) </p><p>teacher.  For </p><p>some  time  afterwards  he  was  a  private  tutor, </p><p>and  having  meanwhile  become  naturalised,  he </p><p>obtained  a  post  as  engineer  in  the  Swiss  Patent </p><p>Office in 1902, which position he occupied till 1909. </p><p>The  main  ideas  involved  in  the  most  important </p><p>of  Einstein’s  theories  date  back  to  this  period. </p><p>Amongst  these  may  be  mentioned:  The  Special </p><p>Theory of Relativity, Inertia of Energy, Theory of </p><p>the  Brownian  Movement,  and  the  Quantum-Law </p><p>of  the  Emission  and  Absorption  of  Light  (1905). </p><p>These  were  followed  some  years  later  by  the </p><p>vii </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>viii                             RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>Theory of the Specific Heat of Solid Bodies, and the </p><p>fundamental idea of the General Theory of Relativity. </p><p>During  the  interval  1909  to  1911  he  occupied </p><p>the  post  of  Professor  Extraordinarius  at  the </p><p>University of Zurich, afterwards being appointed </p><p>to  the  University  of  Prague,  Bohemia,  where  he </p><p>remained  as  Professor  Ordinarius  until  1912. </p><p>In  the  latter  year  Professor  Einstein  accepted  a </p><p>similar  chair  at  the  Polytechnikum,  Zurich,  and </p><p>continued  his  activities  there  until  1914,  when </p><p>he  received  a  call  to  the  Prussian  Academy  of </p><p>Science,  Berlin,  as  successor  to  Van’t  Hoff. </p><p>Professor  Einstein  is  able  to  devote  himself </p><p>freely  to  his  studies  at  the  Berlin  Academy,  and </p><p>it  was  here  that  he  succeeded  in  completing  his </p><p>work on the General Theory of Relativity (1915–</p><p>17).  Professor  Einstein  also  lectures  on  various </p><p>special  branches  of  physics  at  the  University  of </p><p>Berlin,  and,  in  addition,  he  is  Director  of  the </p><p>Institute *  for  Physical  Research  of  the  Kaiser </p><p>Wilhelm Gesellschaft.  </p><p></p><p>Professor  Einstein  has  been  twice  married. </p><p>His first wife, whom he married at Berne in 1903, </p><p>was  a  fellow-student  from  Serbia.  There  were </p><p>two sons of this marriage, both of whom are liv-</p><p>ing in Zurich, the elder being sixteen years of age. </p><p>Recently  Professor  Einstein  married  a  widowed </p><p>cousin,  with  whom  he  is  now  living  in  Berlin. </p><p></p><p>R.

By  reason  of </p><p>your past experience, you would certainly regard </p><p>every  one  with  disdain  who  should  pronounce </p><p>even  the  most  out-of-the-way  proposition  of  this </p><p>science  to  be  untrue.  But  perhaps  this  feeling  of </p><p>proud  certainty  would  leave  you  immediately  if </p><p>some  one  were  to  ask  you:  “What,  then,  do  you </p><p>mean by the assertion that these propositions are </p><p>true?”  Let  us  proceed  to  give  this  question  a </p><p>little consideration.  </p><p></p><p>Geometry sets out from certain conceptions such </p><p>as  “plane,”  “point,”  and  “straight  line,”  with </p><p>1 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>2        SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>which we are able to associate more or less defi-</p><p>nite  ideas,  and  from  certain  simple  propositions </p><p>(axioms)  which,  in  virtue  of  these  ideas,  we  are </p><p>inclined  to  accept  as  “true.”  Then,  on  the  basis </p><p>of a logical process, the justification of which we </p><p>feel  ourselves  compelled  to  admit,  all  remaining </p><p>propositions are shown to follow from those axioms, </p><p>i.e. they are proven. A proposition is then correct </p><p>(“true”)  when  it  has  been  derived  in  the  recog-</p><p>nised  manner  from  the  axioms.  The  question  of </p><p>the  “truth”  of  the  individual  geometrical  propo-</p><p>sitions  is  thus  reduced  to  one  of  the  “truth”  of </p><p>the  axioms.  Now  it  has  long  been  known  that </p><p>the last question is not only unanswerable by the </p><p>methods  of  geometry,  but  that  it  is  in  itself  en-</p><p>tirely  without  meaning.  We  cannot  ask  whether </p><p>it is true that only one straight line goes through </p><p>two  points.  We  can  only  say  that  Euclidean  ge-</p><p>ometry  deals  with  things  called  “straight  lines,” </p><p>to each of which is ascribed the property of being </p><p>uniquely determined by two points situated on it. </p><p>The  concept  “true”  does  not  tally  with  the </p><p>assertions of pure geometry, because by the word </p><p>“true”  we  are  eventually  in  the  habit  of  desig-</p><p>nating  always  the  correspondence  with  a  “real” </p><p>object; geometry, however, is not concerned with </p><p>the  relation  of  the  ideas  involved  in  it  to  objects </p><p>of experience, but only with the logical connection </p><p>of these ideas among themselves. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>GEOMETRICAL  PROPOSITIONS             3 </p><p></p><p>It is not difficult to understand why, in spite of </p><p>this, we feel constrained to call the propositions of </p><p>geometry  “true.”  Geometrical  ideas  correspond </p><p>to more or less exact objects in nature, and these </p><p>last  are  undoubtedly  the  exclusive  cause  of  the </p><p>genesis of those ideas. Geometry ought to refrain </p><p>from such a course, in order to give to its structure </p><p>the  largest  possible  logical  unity.  The  practice, </p><p>for example, of seeing in a “distance” two marked </p><p>positions on a practically rigid body is something </p><p>which  is  lodged  deeply  in  our  habit  of  thought. </p><p>We are accustomed further to regard three points </p><p>as  being  situated  on  a  straight  line,  if  their  ap-</p><p>parent positions  can be  made to  coincide for ob-</p><p>servation  with  one  eye,  under  suitable  choice  of </p><p>our place of observation.  </p><p></p><p>If, in pursuance of our habit of thought, we now </p><p>supplement the propositions of Euclidean geometry </p><p>by  the  single  proposition  that  two  points  on  a </p><p>practically  rigid  body  always  correspond  to  the </p><p>same  distance  (line-interval),  independently  of </p><p>any changes in position to which we may subject </p><p>the body, the propositions of Euclidean geometry </p><p>then  resolve  themselves  into  propositions  on  the </p><p>possible relative position of practically rigid bodies.1  </p><p>1 It follows that a natural object is associated also with a straight </p><p>line.  Three  points  A,  B  and  C  on  a  rigid  body  thus  lie  in  a  straight </p><p>line when, the points A and C being given, B is chosen such that the </p><p>sum  of  the  distances  AB  and  BC  is  as  short  as  possible.  This  in-</p><p>complete suggestion will suffice for our present purpose. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>  </p><p></p><p>4        SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>Geometry  which  has  been  supplemented </p><p>in </p><p>this  way  is  then  to  be  treated  as  a  branch  of </p><p>physics.  We  can  now  legitimately  ask  as  to  the </p><p>“truth”  of  geometrical  propositions  interpreted </p><p>in this way, since we are justified in asking whether </p><p>these propositions are satisfied for those real things </p><p>we have associated with the geometrical ideas. In </p><p>less  exact  terms  we  can  express  this  by  saying </p><p>that  by  the  “truth”  of  a  geometrical  proposition </p><p>in this sense we understand its validity for a con-</p><p>struction with ruler and compasses.  </p><p></p><p>Of course the conviction of the “truth” of geo-</p><p>metrical  propositions  in  this  sense  is  founded </p><p>exclusively  on  rather  incomplete  experience.  For </p><p>the  present  we  shall  assume  the  “truth”  of  the </p><p>geometrical  propositions,  then  at  a  later  stage </p><p>(in  the  general  theory  of  relativity)  we  shall  see </p><p>that this “truth” is limited, and we shall consider </p><p>the extent of its limitation. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>II </p><p></p><p>THE  SYSTEM  OF  CO–ORDINATES </p><p></p><p>O </p><p></p><p>N the basis of the physical interpretation of </p><p>  distance which has been indicated, we are </p><p>  also in a position to establish the distance </p><p>between two points on a rigid body by means of </p><p>measurements.  For  this  purpose  we  require  a </p><p>“distance”  (rod  S)  which  is  to  be  used  once  and </p><p>for all, and which we employ as a standard measure. </p><p>If, now, A and B are two points on a rigid body, </p><p>we can construct the line joining them according </p><p>to  the  rules  of  geometry;  then,  starting  from  A, </p><p>we  can  mark  off  the  distance  S  time  after  time </p><p>until we reach B. The number of these operations </p><p>required is the numerical measure of the distance </p><p>AB.  This  is  the  basis  of  all  measurement  of </p><p>length.1  </p><p></p><p>Every description of the scene of an event or of </p><p>the position of an object in space is based on the </p><p>specification of the point on a rigid body (body of </p><p>reference)  with  which  that  event  or  object  coin- </p><p>1 Here  we  have  assumed  that  there  is  nothing  left  over,  i.e.  that </p><p>the  measurement  gives  a  whole  number.  This  difficulty  is  got  over </p><p>by  the  use  of  divided  measuring-rods,  the  introduction  of  which </p><p>does  not  demand  any  fundamentally  new  method. </p><p></p><p>5 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>6        SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>cides. This applies not only to scientific descrip-</p><p>tion,  but  also  to  everyday  life.  If  I  analyse  the </p><p>place specification “Trafalgar Square, London,” 1 </p><p>I  arrive  at  the  following  result.  The  earth  is  the </p><p>rigid  body  to  which  the  specification  of  place </p><p>refers;  “Trafalgar  Square,  London”  is  a  well- </p><p>defined point, to which a name has been assigned, </p><p>and with which the event coincides in space.2 </p><p></p><p>This  primitive  method  of  place  specification </p><p>deals only with places on the surface of rigid bodies, </p><p>and  is  dependent  on  the  existence  of  points  on </p><p>this  surface  which  are  distinguishable  from  each </p><p>other.  But  we  can  free  ourselves  from  both  of </p><p>these  limitations  without  altering  the  nature  of </p><p>our  specification  of  position.  If,  for  instance,  a </p><p>cloud is hovering over Trafalgar Square, then we </p><p>can  determine  its  position  relative  to  the  surface </p><p>of the earth by erecting a pole perpendicularly on </p><p>the  Square,  so  that  it  reaches  the  cloud.  The </p><p>length  of  the  pole  measured  with  the  standard </p><p>measuring-rod, combined with the specification of </p><p>the  position  of  the  foot  of  the  pole,  supplies  us </p><p>with a complete place specification. On the basis </p><p></p><p>1 I  have  chosen  this  as  being  more  familiar  to  the  English  reader </p><p>than  the  “Potsdamer  Platz,  Berlin,”  which  is  referred  to  in  the </p><p>original.   (R. W. L.) </p><p></p><p>2 It  is  not  necessary  here  to  investigate  further  the  significance </p><p>of  the  expression  “coincidence  in  space.”  This  conception  is  suf-</p><p>ficiently  obvious  to  ensure  that  differences  of  opinion  are  scarcely </p><p>likely to arise as to its applicability in practice. </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>THE  SYSTEM  OF  CO–ORDINATES          7 </p><p></p><p>of this illustration, we are able to see the manner </p><p>in which a refinement of the conception of position </p><p>has been developed.  </p><p></p><p>(a) We  imagine  the  rigid  body,  to  which  the </p><p>place  specification  is  referred,  supplemented  in </p><p>such a manner that the object whose position we </p><p>require is reached by the completed rigid body.  </p><p></p><p>(b) In  locating  the  position  of  the  object,  we </p><p>make use of a number (here the length of the pole </p><p>measured  with  the  measuring-rod)  instead  of </p><p>designated points of reference.  </p><p></p><p>(c) We  speak  of  the  height  of  the  cloud  even </p><p>when  the  pole  which  reaches  the  cloud  has  not </p><p>been  erected.  By  means  of  optical  observations </p><p>of  the  cloud  from  different  positions  on  the </p><p>ground, and taking into account the properties of </p><p>the propagation of light, we determine the length </p><p>of  the  pole  we  should  have  required  in  order  to </p><p>reach the cloud.  </p><p></p><p>From  this  consideration  we  see  that  it  will  be </p><p>advantageous if,  in the description  of  position, it </p><p>should be possible by means of numerical measures </p><p>to make ourselves independent of the existence of </p><p>marked positions (possessing names) on the rigid </p><p>body of reference. In the physics of measurement </p><p>this is attained by the application of the Cartesian </p><p>system of co-ordinates.  </p><p></p><p>This consists of three plane surfaces perpendicu-</p><p>lar  to  each  other  and  rigidly  attached  to  a  rigid </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>8        SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>body.  Referred  to  a  system  of  co-ordinates,  the </p><p>scene  of  any  event  will  be  determined  (for  the </p><p>main  part)  by  the  specification  of  the  lengths  of </p><p>the  three  perpendiculars  or  co-ordinates  (x,  y,  z) </p><p>which can be dropped from the scene of the event </p><p>to  those  three  plane  surfaces.  The  lengths  of </p><p>these  three  perpendiculars  can  be  determined  by </p><p>a  series  of  manipulations  with  rigid  measuring- </p><p>rods performed according to the rules and methods </p><p>laid down by Euclidean geometry.  </p><p></p><p>In practice, the rigid surfaces which constitute </p><p>the  system  of  co-ordinates  are  generally  not </p><p>available; furthermore, the magnitudes of the co- </p><p>ordinates  are  not  actually  determined  by  con-</p><p>structions with rigid rods, but by indirect means. </p><p>If  the  results  of  physics  and  astronomy  are  to </p><p>maintain their clearness, the physical meaning of </p><p>specifications  of  position  must  always  be  sought </p><p>in accordance with the above considerations.1  </p><p></p><p>We  thus  obtain  the  following  result:  Every </p><p>description of events in space involves the use of </p><p>a  rigid  body  to  which  such  events  have  to  be </p><p>referred.  The  resulting  relationship  takes  for </p><p>granted that the laws of Euclidean geometry hold </p><p>for  “distances,”  the  “distance”  being  represented </p><p>physically  by  means  of  the  convention  of  two </p><p>marks on a rigid body. </p><p></p><p>1 A refinement and modification of these views does not become </p><p>necessary until we come to deal with the general theory of relativity, </p><p>treated in the second part of this book. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>  </p><p></p><p>III </p><p></p><p>“ T </p><p></p><p>SPACE  AND  TIME  IN  CLASSICAL  MECHANICS </p><p></p><p>HE purpose of mechanics is to describe how </p><p>  bodies change their position in space with </p><p>  time.” I should load my conscience with </p><p>grave  sins  against  the  sacred  spirit  of  lucidity </p><p>were I to formulate the aims of mechanics in this </p><p>way,  without  serious  reflection  and  detailed  ex-</p><p>planations. Let us proceed to disclose these sins.  </p><p>It is not clear what is to be understood here by </p><p>“position”  and  “space.”  I  stand  at  the  window </p><p>of a railway carriage which is travelling uniformly, </p><p>and  drop  a  stone  on  the  embankment,  without </p><p>throwing  it.  Then,  disregarding  the  influence  of </p><p>the  air  resistance,  I  see  the  stone  descend  in  a </p><p>straight line. A pedestrian who observes the mis-</p><p>deed  from  the  footpath  notices  that  the  stone </p><p>falls  to  earth  in  a  parabolic  curve.  I  now  ask: </p><p>Do  the  “positions”  traversed  by  the  stone  lie  “in </p><p>reality”  on  a  straight  line  or  on  a  parabola? </p><p>Moreover,  what  is  meant  here  by  motion  “in </p><p>space”?  From  the  considerations  of  the  previous </p><p>section  the  answer  is  self-evident.  In  the  first </p><p>place,  we  entirely  shun  the  vague  word  “space,” </p><p>9 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>10      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>of which, we must honestly acknowledge, we can-</p><p>not form the slightest conception, and we replace </p><p>it  by  “motion  relative  to  a  practically  rigid  body </p><p>of  reference.”  The  positions  relative  to  the  body </p><p>of  reference  (railway  carriage  or  embankment) </p><p>have already been defined in detail in the preced-</p><p>ing  section.  If  instead  of  “body  of  reference” </p><p>we  insert  “system  of  co-ordinates,”  which  is  a </p><p>useful  idea  for  mathematical  description,  we  are </p><p>in a position to say: The stone traverses a straight </p><p>line  relative  to  a  system  of  co-ordinates  rigidly </p><p>attached  to  the  carriage,  but  relative  to  a  system </p><p>of  co-ordinates  rigidly  attached  to  the  ground </p><p>(embankment)  it  describes  a  parabola.  With  the </p><p>aid of this example it is clearly seen that there is </p><p>no  such  thing  as  an  independently  existing  tra-</p><p>jectory  (lit.  “path-curve” 1),  but  only  a  trajectory </p><p>relative to a particular body of reference.  </p><p></p><p>In  order  to  have  a  complete  description  of  the </p><p>motion,  we  must  specify  how  the  body  alters  its </p><p>position  with  time;  i.e.  for  every  point  on  the </p><p>trajectory  it  must  be  stated  at  what  time  the </p><p>body  is  situated  there.  These  data  must  be </p><p>supplemented  by  such  a  definition  of  time  that, </p><p>in virtue of this definition, these time-values can </p><p>be  regarded  essentially  as  magnitudes  (results  of </p><p>measurements)  capable  of  observation.  If  we </p><p>take  our  stand  on  the  ground  of  classical  me- </p><p>1 That is, a curve along which the body moves. </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SPACE  AND  TIME                         11 </p><p></p><p>chanics,  we  can  satisfy  this  requirement  for  our </p><p>illustration in the following manner. We imagine </p><p>two  clocks  of  identical  construction;  the  man  at </p><p>the  railway-carriage  window  is  holding  one  of </p><p>them,  and  the  man  on  the  footpath  the  other. </p><p>Each of the observers determines the position on </p><p>his own  reference-body  occupied by  the stone  at </p><p>each  tick  of  the  clock  he  is  holding  in  his  hand. </p><p>In  this  connection  we  have  not  taken  account  of </p><p>the  inaccuracy  involved  by  the  finiteness  of  the </p><p>velocity  of  propagation  of  light.  With  this  and </p><p>with  a  second  difficulty  prevailing  here  we  shall </p><p>have to deal in detail later. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>IV </p><p></p><p>THE  GALILEIAN  SYSTEM  OF </p><p>CO–ORDINATES </p><p></p><p>A </p><p></p><p>S is well known, the fundamental law of the </p><p>  mechanics  of  Galilei-Newton,  which  is </p><p>  known as the law of inertia, can be stated </p><p>thus: A body removed sufficiently far from other </p><p>bodies  continues  in  a  state  of  rest  or  of  uniform </p><p>motion  in  a  straight  line.  This  law  not  only  says </p><p>something  about  the  motion  of  the  bodies,  but  it </p><p>also  indicates  the  reference-bodies  or  systems  of </p><p>co-ordinates, permissible in mechanics, which can </p><p>be  used  in  mechanical  description.

We  call  its  motion  a  uniform  transla-</p><p>tion (“uniform” because it is of constant velocity </p><p>and  direction,  “translation”  because  although </p><p>the  carriage  changes  its  position  relative  to  the </p><p>embankment  yet  it  does  not  rotate  in  so  doing). </p><p>Let  us  imagine  a  raven  flying  through  the  air  in </p><p>such  a  manner  that  its  motion,  as  observed  from </p><p>the embankment, is uniform and in a straight line. </p><p>If  we  were  to  observe  the  flying  raven  from  the </p><p>moving railway carriage, we should find that the </p><p>motion of the raven would be one of different veloc-</p><p>ity  and  direction,  but  that  it  would  still  be  uni-</p><p>form  and  in  a  straight  line.  Expressed  in  an </p><p>abstract  manner  we  may  say:  If  a  mass  m  is </p><p>moving  uniformly  in  a  straight  line  with  respect </p><p>to  a  co-ordinate  system  K,  then  it  will  also  be </p><p>moving  uniformly  and  in  a  straight  line  relative </p><p>to  a  second  co-ordinate  system  K',  provided  that </p><p>14 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>THE  PRINCIPLE  OF  RELATIVITY         15 </p><p></p><p>the  latter  is  executing  a  uniform  translatory </p><p>motion with respect to K. In accordance with the </p><p>discussion  contained  in  the  preceding  section,  it </p><p>follows that:  </p><p></p><p>If  K  is  a  Galileian  co-ordinate  system,  then </p><p>every  other  co-ordinate  system  K'  is  a  Galileian </p><p>one, when, in relation to K, it is in a condition of </p><p>uniform  motion  of  translation.  Relative  to  K' </p><p>the mechanical laws of Galilei-Newton hold good </p><p>exactly as they do with respect to K.  </p><p></p><p>We advance a step farther in our generalisation </p><p>when  we  express  the  tenet  thus:  If,  relative  to </p><p>K,  K'  is  a  uniformly  moving  co-ordinate  system </p><p>devoid  of  rotation,  then  natural  phenomena  run </p><p>their  course  with  respect  to  K'  according  to </p><p>exactly  the  same  general  laws  as  with  respect  to </p><p>K.  This  statement  is  called  the  principle  of </p><p>relativity (in the restricted sense).  </p><p></p><p>As  long  as  one  was  convinced  that  all  natural </p><p>phenomena  were  capable  of  representation  with </p><p>the help of classical mechanics, there was no need </p><p>to doubt the validity of this principle of relativity. </p><p>But  in  view  of  the  more  recent  development  of </p><p>electrodynamics  and  optics  it  became  more  and </p><p>more  evident  that  classical  mechanics  affords  an </p><p>insufficient foundation for the physical description </p><p>of  all  natural  phenomena.  At  this  juncture  the </p><p>question of the validity of the principle of relativity </p><p>became ripe for discussion, and it did not appear </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>16      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>impossible that the answer to this question might </p><p>be in the negative. </p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, there are two general facts which </p><p>at  the  outset  speak  very  much  in  favour  of  the </p><p>validity  of  the  principle  of  relativity.  Even </p><p>though  classical  mechanics  does  not  supply  us </p><p>with a sufficiently broad basis for the theoretical </p><p>presentation  of  all  physical  phenomena,  still  we </p><p>must  grant  it  a  considerable  measure  of  “truth,” </p><p>since it supplies us with the actual motions of the </p><p>heavenly  bodies  with  a  delicacy  of  detail  little </p><p>short  of  wonderful.  The  principle  of  relativity </p><p>must  therefore  apply  with  great  accuracy  in  the </p><p>domain  of  mechanics.  But  that  a  principle  of </p><p>such  broad  generality  should  hold  with  such </p><p>exactness  in  one  domain  of  phenomena,  and  yet </p><p>should be invalid for another, is a priori not very </p><p>probable.  </p><p></p><p>We  now  proceed  to  the  second  argument,  to </p><p>which,  moreover,  we  shall  return  later.  If  the </p><p>principle  of  relativity  (in  the  restricted  sense) </p><p>does  not  hold,  then  the  Galileian  co-ordinate </p><p>systems  K,  K',  K'',  etc.,  which  are  moving  uni-</p><p>formly relative to each other, will not be equivalent </p><p>for  the  description  of  natural  phenomena.  In </p><p>this case we should be constrained to believe that </p><p>natural laws are capable of being formulated in a </p><p>particularly simple manner, and of course only on </p><p>condition that, from amongst all possible Galileian </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>THE  PRINCIPLE  OF  RELATIVITY         17 </p><p></p><p>co-ordinate  systems,  we  should  have  chosen  one </p><p>(K0) of a particular state of motion as our body of </p><p>reference.  We  should  then  be  justified  (because </p><p>of  its  merits  for  the  description  of  natural  phe-</p><p>nomena)  in  calling  this  system  “absolutely  at </p><p>rest,”  and  all  other  Galileian  systems  K  “in  mo-</p><p>tion.”  If,  for  instance,  our  embankment  were  the </p><p>system  K0,  then  our  railway  carriage  would  be  a </p><p>system K, relative to which less simple laws would </p><p>hold  than  with  respect  to  K0.  This  diminished </p><p>simplicity would be due to the fact that the carriage </p><p>K would be in motion (i.e. “really”) with respect </p><p>to  K0.  In  the  general  laws  of  nature  which  have </p><p>been  formulated  with  reference  to  K,  the  magni-</p><p>tude and direction of  the velocity  of  the  carriage </p><p>would necessarily play a part. We should expect, </p><p>for  instance,  that  the  note  emitted  by  an  organ- </p><p>pipe placed with its axis parallel to the direction of </p><p>travel would be different from that emitted if the </p><p>axis of the pipe were placed perpendicular to this </p><p>direction. Now in virtue of its motion in an orbit </p><p>round the sun, our earth is comparable with a rail-</p><p>way  carriage  travelling  with  a  velocity  of  about </p><p>30  kilometres  per  second.  If  the  principle  of </p><p>relativity were not valid we should therefore expect </p><p>that  the  direction  of  motion  of  the  earth  at  any </p><p>moment would enter into the laws of nature, and </p><p>also  that  physical  systems  in  their  behaviour </p><p>would  be  dependent  on  the  orientation  in  space </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>18      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>with respect to the earth. For owing to the altera-</p><p>tion in direction of the velocity of rotation * of the </p><p>earth in the course of a year, the earth cannot be </p><p>at  rest  relative  to  the  hypothetical  system  K0 </p><p>throughout  the  whole  year.  However,  the  most </p><p>careful  observations  have  never  revealed  such </p><p>anisotropic properties in terrestrial physical space, </p><p>i.e. a physical non-equivalence of different direc-</p><p>tions. This is a very powerful argument in favour </p><p>of the principle of relativity. </p><p></p><p>[*  The  word  “rotation”  was  correctly  changed  to  “revolution”  in </p><p></p><p>later editions. — J.M.] </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>VI </p><p></p><p>THE  THEOREM  OF  THE  ADDITION  OF </p><p>VELOCITIES  EMPLOYED  IN  CLASSI-</p><p>CAL  MECHANICS </p><p></p><p>L </p><p></p><p>ET  us  suppose  our  old  friend  the  railway </p><p>  carriage to be travelling along the rails with </p><p>  a  constant  velocity  v,  and  that  a  man </p><p>traverses the length of the carriage in the direction </p><p>of  travel  with  a  velocity  w.  How  quickly,  or,  in </p><p>other words, with what velocity  W does the man </p><p>advance  relative  to  the  embankment  during  the </p><p>process?  The  only  possible  answer  seems  to </p><p>result  from  the  following  consideration:  If  the </p><p>man  were  to  stand  still  for  a  second,  he  would </p><p>advance  relative  to  the  embankment  through  a </p><p>distance v equal numerically to the velocity of the </p><p>carriage.

Thus  in  total  he  covers  the  distance </p><p>W = v + w  relative  to  the  embankment  in  the </p><p>second  considered.

Every child at school </p><p>knows, or believes he knows, that this propagation </p><p>takes  place  in  straight  lines  with  a  velocity </p><p>c = 300,000  km./sec.  At  all  events  we  know  with </p><p>great  exactness  that  this  velocity  is  the  same  for </p><p>all colours, because if this were not the case, the </p><p>minimum  of  emission  would  not  be  observed </p><p>simultaneously  for  different  colours  during  the </p><p>eclipse  of  a  fixed  star  by  its  dark  neighbour.  By </p><p>means of similar considerations based on observa-</p><p>tions  of  double  stars,  the  Dutch  astronomer  De </p><p>Sitter  was  also  able  to  show  that  the  velocity  of </p><p>propagation of light cannot depend on the velocity </p><p>of  motion  of  the  body  emitting  the  light.  The </p><p>assumption  that  this  velocity  of  propagation  is </p><p>dependent  on the direction  “in  space”  is  in  itself </p><p>improbable.  </p><p></p><p>In  short,  let  us  assume  that  the  simple  law  of </p><p>the constancy of the velocity of light c (in vacuum) </p><p>21 </p><p></p><p> </p><p>  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>22      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>is justifiably believed by the child at school. Who </p><p>would  imagine  that  this  simple  law  has  plunged </p><p>the  conscientiously  thoughtful  physicist  into  the </p><p>greatest  intellectual  difficulties?  Let  us  consider </p><p>how these difficulties arise.  </p><p></p><p>Of  course  we  must  refer  the  process  of  the </p><p>propagation  of  light  (and  indeed  every  other </p><p>process)  to  a  rigid  reference-body  (co-ordinate </p><p>system).  As  such  a  system  let  us  again  choose </p><p>our embankment. We shall imagine the air above </p><p>it to have been removed. If a ray of light be sent </p><p>along  the  embankment,  we  see  from  the  above </p><p>that  the  tip  of  the  ray  will  be  transmitted  with </p><p>the  velocity  c  relative  to  the  embankment.  Now </p><p>let  us  suppose  that  our  railway  carriage  is  again </p><p>travelling along the railway lines with the velocity </p><p>v, and that its direction is the same as that of the </p><p>ray of light, but its velocity of course much less. </p><p>Let  us  inquire  about  the  velocity  of  propagation </p><p>of  the  ray  of  light  relative  to  the  carriage.  It  is </p><p>obvious that we can here apply the consideration </p><p>of the previous section, since the ray of light plays </p><p>the  part  of  the  man  walking  along  relatively  to </p><p>the  carriage.  The  velocity  W  of  the  man  relative </p><p>to the embankment is here replaced by the velocity </p><p>of  light  relative  to  the  embankment.  w  is  the </p><p>required  velocity  of  light  with  respect  to  the </p><p>carriage, and we have  </p><p></p><p>w = c -</p><p></p><p> v. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>THE  PROPAGATION  OF  LIGHT           23 </p><p></p><p>The  velocity  of  propagation  of  a  ray  of  light </p><p>relative  to  the  carriage  thus  comes  out  smaller </p><p>than c.  </p><p></p><p>But  this  result  comes  into  conflict  with  the </p><p>principle of relativity set forth in Section V. For, </p><p>like every other general law of nature, the law of </p><p>the transmission of light in vacuo must, according </p><p>to  the  principle  of  relativity,  be  the  same  for  the </p><p>railway  carriage  as  reference-body  as  when  the </p><p>rails  are  the  body  of  reference.  But,  from  our </p><p>above consideration, this would appear to be im-</p><p>possible. If every ray of light is propagated rela-</p><p>tive to the embankment with the velocity c, then </p><p>for  this  reason  it  would  appear  that  another  law </p><p>of propagation of light must necessarily hold with </p><p>respect to the carriage — a result contradictory to </p><p>the principle of relativity.  </p><p></p><p>In  view  of  this  dilemma  there  appears  to  be </p><p>nothing  else  for  it  than  to  abandon  either  the </p><p>principle  of  relativity  or  the  simple  law  of  the </p><p>propagation of light in vacuo. Those of you who </p><p>have carefully followed the preceding discussion </p><p>are  almost  sure  to  expect  that  we  should  retain </p><p>the principle of  relativity,  which  appeals  so  con-</p><p>vincingly  to  the  intellect  because  it  is  so  natural </p><p>and  simple.  The  law  of  the  propagation  of  light </p><p>in  vacuo  would  then  have  to  be  replaced  by  a </p><p>more complicated law conformable to the principle </p><p>of  relativity.  The  development  of  theoretical </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>24      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>physics  shows,  however,  that  we  cannot  pursue </p><p>this  course.  The  epoch-making  theoretical  in-</p><p>vestigations  of  H.  A.  Lorentz  on  the  electrody-</p><p>namical  and  optical  phenomena  connected  with </p><p>moving bodies show that experience in this domain </p><p>leads conclusively to a theory of electromagnetic </p><p>phenomena, of which the law of the constancy of </p><p>the velocity of light in vacuo is a necessary conse-</p><p>quence.  Prominent  theoretical  physicists  were </p><p>therefore  more  inclined  to  reject  the  principle  of </p><p>relativity,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  no  empirical </p><p>data had been found which were contradictory to </p><p>this principle.  </p><p></p><p>At this juncture the theory of relativity entered </p><p>the arena. As a result of an analysis of the physical </p><p>conceptions of time and space, it became evident </p><p>that in reality there is not the least incompatibility </p><p>between the principle of relativity and the law of </p><p>propagation  of  light,  and  that  by  systematically </p><p>holding  fast  to  both  these  laws  a  logically  rigid </p><p>theory  could  be  arrived  at.  This  theory  has  been </p><p>called the special theory of relativity to distinguish </p><p>it from the extended theory, with which we shall </p><p>deal later. In the following pages we shall present </p><p>the  fundamental  ideas  of  the  special  theory  of </p><p>relativity. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>VIII </p><p></p><p>ON  THE  IDEA  OF  TIME  IN  PHYSICS </p><p></p><p>L </p><p></p><p>IGHTNING has struck the rails on our rail-</p><p>  way  embankment  at  two  places  A  and  B </p><p>  far  distant  from  each  other.  I  make  the </p><p>additional  assertion  that  these  two  lightning </p><p>flashes  occurred  simultaneously.  If  now  I  ask </p><p>you whether there is sense in this statement, you </p><p>will  answer  my  question  with  a  decided  “Yes.” </p><p>But  if  I  now  approach  you  with  the  request  to </p><p>explain  to  me  the  sense  of  the  statement  more </p><p>precisely,  you  find  after  some  consideration  that </p><p>the  answer  to  this  question  is  not  so  easy  as  it </p><p>appears at first sight.  </p><p></p><p>After some time perhaps the following answer </p><p>would  occur  to  you:  “The  significance  of  the </p><p>statement  is  clear  in  itself  and  needs  no  further </p><p>explanation; of course it would require some con-</p><p>sideration if I were to be commissioned to deter-</p><p>mine  by  observations  whether  in  the  actual  case </p><p>the two events took place simultaneously or not.” </p><p>I cannot be satisfied with this answer for the follow-</p><p>ing reason. Supposing that as a result of ingenious </p><p>considerations an able meteorologist were to dis- </p><p>25 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>26      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>cover  that  the  lightning  must  always  strike  the </p><p>places A and B simultaneously, then we should be </p><p>faced with the task of testing whether or not this </p><p>theoretical result is in accordance with the reality. </p><p>We encounter the same difficulty with all physical </p><p>statements  in  which  the  conception  “simultane-</p><p>ous”  plays  a  part.  The  concept  does  not  exist </p><p>for  the  physicist  until  he  has  the  possibility  of </p><p>discovering  whether  or  not  it  is  fulfilled  in  an </p><p>actual  case.  We  thus  require  a  definition  of </p><p>simultaneity  such  that  this  definition  supplies  us </p><p>with the method by means of which, in the present </p><p>case, he can decide by experiment whether or not </p><p>both  the  lightning  strokes  occurred  simultane-</p><p>ously. As long as this requirement is not satisfied, </p><p>I allow myself to be deceived as a physicist (and </p><p>of course the same applies if I am not a physicist), </p><p>when I imagine that I am able to attach a meaning </p><p>to  the  statement  of  simultaneity.  (I  would  ask </p><p>the reader not to proceed farther until he is fully </p><p>convinced on this point.)  </p><p></p><p>After  thinking  the  matter  over  for  some  time </p><p>you then offer the following suggestion with which </p><p>to  test  simultaneity.  By  measuring  along  the </p><p>rails, the connecting line AB should be measured </p><p>up  and  an  observer  placed  at  the  mid-point  M </p><p>of  the  distance  AB.  This  observer  should  be </p><p>supplied  with  an  arrangement  (e.g.  two  mirrors </p><p>inclined at 90°) which allows him visually to ob- </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>IDEA  OF  TIME  IN  PHYSICS              27 </p><p></p><p>serve  both  places  A  and  B  at  the  same  time.  If </p><p>the observer perceives the two flashes of lightning </p><p>at the same time, then they are simultaneous.  </p><p></p><p>I am very pleased with this suggestion, but for </p><p>all that I cannot regard the matter as quite settled, </p><p>because  I  feel  constrained  to  raise  the  following </p><p>objection:  “Your  definition  would  certainly  be </p><p>right,  if  I  only  knew  that  the  light  by  means  of </p><p>which  the  observer  at  M  perceives  the  lightning </p><p>flashes travels along the length A ~T M with the </p><p>same  velocity  as  along  the  length  B  ~T  M. </p><p>But an examination of this supposition would only </p><p>be possible if we already had at our disposal the </p><p>means  of  measuring  time.  It  would  thus  appear </p><p>as though we were moving here in a logical circle.” </p><p>After further consideration you cast a somewhat </p><p>disdainful  glance  at  me — and  rightly  so — and </p><p>you  declare:  “I  maintain  my  previous  definition </p><p>nevertheless,  because  in  reality  it  assumes  ab-</p><p>solutely  nothing  about  light.  There  is  only  one </p><p>demand  to  be  made  of  the  definition  of  simulta-</p><p>neity,  namely,  that  in  every  real  case  it  must </p><p>supply us with an empirical decision as to whether </p><p>or  not  the  conception  that  has  to  be  defined  is </p><p>fulfilled. That my definition satisfies this demand </p><p>is  indisputable.  That  light  requires  the  same </p><p>time  to  traverse  the  path  A  ~T  M  as  for  the </p><p>path  B  ~T  M  is  in  reality  neither  a  supposition </p><p>nor a hypothesis about the physical nature of light, </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>28      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>but  a  stipulation  which  I  can  make  of  my  own </p><p>freewill  in  order  to  arrive  at  a  definition  of </p><p>simultaneity.”  </p><p></p><p>It  is  clear  that  this  definition  can  be  used  to </p><p>give an exact meaning not only to two events, but </p><p>to  as  many  events  as  we  care  to  choose,  and  in-</p><p>dependently  of the positions of  the scenes of the </p><p>events  with  respect  to  the  body  of  reference 1 </p><p>(here  the  railway  embankment).  We  are  thus  led </p><p>also  to  a  definition  of  “time”  in  physics.  For </p><p>this  purpose  we  suppose  that  clocks  of  identical </p><p>construction  are  placed  at  the  points  A,  B  and  C </p><p>of the railway line (co-ordinate system), and that </p><p>they  are  set  in  such  a  manner  that  the  positions </p><p>of their pointers are simultaneously (in the above </p><p>sense)  the  same.  Under  these  conditions  we </p><p>understand by the “time” of an event the reading </p><p>(position of the hands) of that one of these clocks </p><p>which  is  in  the  immediate  vicinity  (in  space)  of </p><p>the  event.  In  this  manner  a  time-value  is  asso-</p><p>ciated with every event which is essentially capable </p><p>of observation.  </p><p></p><p>This  stipulation  contains  a  further  physical </p><p>1 We  suppose  further  that,  when  three  events  A,  B  and  C  take </p><p>place  in  different  places  in  such  a  manner  that,  if  A  is  simultaneous </p><p>with  B,  and  B  is  simultaneous  with  C  (simultaneous  in  the  sense  of </p><p>the  above  definition),  then  the  criterion  for  the  simultaneity  of  the </p><p>pair  of  events  A,  C  is  also  satisfied.  This  assumption  is  a  physical </p><p>hypothesis  about  the  law  of  propagation  of  light;  it  must  certainly </p><p>be  fulfilled  if  we  are  to  maintain  the  law  of  the  constancy  of  the </p><p>velocity of light in vacuo. </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>IDEA  OF  TIME  IN  PHYSICS              29 </p><p></p><p>hypothesis,  the  validity  of  which  will  hardly  be </p><p>doubted  without  empirical  evidence  to  the  con-</p><p>trary.  It  has  been  assumed  that  all  these  clocks </p><p>go at the same rate if they are of identical construc-</p><p>tion.  Stated  more  exactly:  When  two  clocks </p><p>arranged at rest in different places of a reference- </p><p>body  are  set  in  such  a  manner  that  a  particular </p><p>position of the pointers of the one clock is simul-</p><p>taneous (in the above sense) with the same position </p><p>of  the  pointers  of  the  other  clock,  then  identical </p><p>“settings”  are  always  simultaneous  (in  the  sense </p><p>of the above definition).  </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>IX </p><p></p><p>THE  RELATIVITY  OF  SIMULTANEITY </p><p></p><p>U </p><p></p><p>P to now our considerations have been re-</p><p>  ferred  to  a  particular  body  of  reference, </p><p>  which we have styled a “railway embank-</p><p>ment.”  We  suppose  a  very  long  train  travelling </p><p>along  the  rails  with  the  constant  velocity  v  and </p><p>in  the  direction  indicated  in  Fig.  1.  People </p><p>travelling  in  this  train  will  with  advantage  use </p><p>the  train  as  a  rigid  reference-body  (co-ordinate </p><p>system);  they  regard  all  events  in  reference  to </p><p></p><p>the  train.  Then  every  event  which  takes  place </p><p>along  the  line  also  takes  place  at  a  particular </p><p>point  of  the  train.  Also  the  definition  of  simul-</p><p>taneity can be given relative to the train in exactly </p><p>the same way as with respect to the embankment. </p><p>As a natural consequence, however, the following </p><p>question arises: </p><p></p><p>Are two events (e.g. the two strokes of lightning </p><p>A and B) which are simultaneous with reference to </p><p>30 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>RELATIVITY  OF  SIMULTANEITY         31 </p><p></p><p>the railway embankment also simultaneous relatively </p><p>to  the  train?  We  shall  show  directly  that  the </p><p>answer must be in the negative.  </p><p></p><p>When we say that the lightning strokes A and B </p><p>are simultaneous with respect to the embankment, </p><p>we  mean:  the  rays  of  light  emitted  at  the  places </p><p>A  and  B,  where  the  lightning  occurs,  meet  each </p><p>other  at  the  mid-point  M  of  the  length  A  ~T  B </p><p>of  the  embankment.  But  the  events  A  and  B </p><p>also  correspond  to  positions  A  and  B  on  the </p><p>train.  Let  M'  be  the  mid-point  of  the  distance </p><p>A  ~T  B  on  the  travelling  train.  Just  when  the </p><p>flashes 1 of lightning occur, this point M' naturally </p><p>coincides with the point M, but it moves towards </p><p>the  right  in  the  diagram  with  the  velocity  v  of </p><p>the  train.  If  an  observer  sitting  in  the  position </p><p>M' in the train did not possess this velocity, then </p><p>he would remain permanently at M, and the light </p><p>rays  emitted  by  the  flashes  of  lightning  A  and  B </p><p>would  reach  him  simultaneously,  i.e. they  would </p><p>meet  just  where  he  is  situated.  Now  in  reality </p><p>(considered with reference to the railway embank-</p><p>ment)  he  is  hastening  towards  the  beam  of  light </p><p>coming from B, whilst he is riding on ahead of the </p><p>beam of light coming from A. Hence the observer </p><p>will see the beam of light emitted from B  earlier </p><p>than  he  will  see  that  emitted  from  A.  Observers </p><p>who take the railway train as their reference-body </p><p>1 As judged from the embankment. </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>32      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>must  therefore  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the </p><p>lightning flash B took place earlier than the light-</p><p>ning  flash  A.  We  thus  arrive  at  the  important </p><p>result:  </p><p></p><p>Events  which  are  simultaneous  with  reference </p><p>to  the  embankment  are  not  simultaneous  with </p><p>respect  to  the  train,  and  vice  versa  (relativity  of </p><p>simultaneity).  Every  reference-body  (co-ordinate </p><p>system)  has  its  own  particular  time;  unless  we </p><p>are told the reference-body to which the statement </p><p>of time refers, there is no meaning in a statement </p><p>of the time of an event.  </p><p></p><p>Now before the advent of the theory of relativity </p><p>it  had  always  tacitly  been  assumed  in  physics </p><p>that  the  statement  of  time  had  an  absolute </p><p>significance, i.e. that it is independent of the state </p><p>of motion of the body of reference. But we have </p><p>just  seen  that  this  assumption  is  incompatible </p><p>with  the  most  natural  definition  of  simultaneity; </p><p>if  we  discard  this  assumption,  then  the  conflict </p><p>between  the  law  of  the  propagation  of  light  in </p><p>vacuo  and  the  principle  of  relativity  (developed </p><p>in Section VII) disappears.  </p><p></p><p>We were led to that conflict by the considera-</p><p>tions  of  Section  VI,  which  are  now  no  longer </p><p>tenable.  In  that  section  we  concluded  that  the </p><p>man  in  the  carriage,  who  traverses  the  distance </p><p>w per second relative to the carriage, traverses the </p><p>same  distance  also  with  respect  to  the  embank- </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>RELATIVITY  OF  SIMULTANEITY         33 </p><p></p><p>ment  in  each  second  of  time.  But,  according  to </p><p>the foregoing considerations, the time required by </p><p>a particular occurrence with respect to the carriage </p><p>must  not  be  considered  equal  to  the  duration  of </p><p>the same occurrence as judged from the embank-</p><p>ment  (as  reference-body).  Hence  it  cannot  be </p><p>contended  that  the  man  in  walking  travels  the </p><p>distance  w  relative  to  the  railway  line  in  a  time </p><p>which is equal to one second as judged from the </p><p>embankment.  </p><p></p><p>Moreover, the considerations of Section VI are </p><p>based on  yet  a  second  assumption,  which,  in  the </p><p>light  of  a  strict  consideration,  appears  to  be </p><p>arbitrary,  although  it  was  always  tacitly  made </p><p>even  before  the  introduction  of  the  theory  of </p><p>relativity. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>X </p><p></p><p>ON  THE  RELATIVITY  OF  THE  CONCEPTION </p><p>OF  DISTANCE </p><p></p><p>L </p><p></p><p>ET us consider two particular points on the </p><p>  train 1  travelling  along  the  embankment </p><p>  with the velocity v, and inquire as to their </p><p>distance apart. We already know that it is neces-</p><p>sary to have a body of reference for the measure-</p><p>ment  of  a  distance,  with  respect  to  which  body </p><p>the distance can be measured up. It is the simplest </p><p>plan  to  use  the  train  itself  as  the  reference-body </p><p>(co-ordinate  system).  An  observer  in  the  train </p><p>measures the interval by marking off his measur-</p><p>ing-rod  in  a  straight  line  (e.g.  along  the  floor  of </p><p>the  carriage)  as  many  times  as  is  necessary  to </p><p>take him from the one marked point to the other. </p><p>Then  the  number  which  tells  us  how  often  the </p><p>rod has to be laid down is the required distance.  </p><p></p><p>It  is  a  different  matter  when  the  distance  has </p><p>to  be  judged  from  the  railway  line.  Here  the </p><p>following  method  suggests  itself.  If  we  call  A' </p><p>and B' the two points on the train whose distance </p><p>apart  is  required,  then  both  of  these  points  are </p><p>1 e.g. the middle of the first and of the hundredth carriage. </p><p></p><p>34 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>THE  RELATIVITY  OF  DISTANCE         35 </p><p></p><p>moving with the velocity v along the embankment. </p><p>In  the  first  place  we  require  to  determine  the </p><p>points  A  and  B  of  the  embankment  which  are </p><p>just  being  passed  by  the  two  points  A'  and  B' </p><p>at a particular time t — judged from the embank-</p><p>ment.  These  points  A  and  B  of  the  embankment </p><p>can  be  determined  by  applying  the  definition  of </p><p>time given in Section VIII. The distance between </p><p>these points A and B is then measured by repeated </p><p>application  of  the  measuring-rod  along  the  em-</p><p>bankment.  </p><p></p><p>A priori it is by no means certain that this last </p><p>measurement will supply us with the same result </p><p>as  the  first.  Thus  the  length  of  the  train  as </p><p>measured from the embankment may be different </p><p>from  that  obtained  by  measuring  in  the  train </p><p>itself.  This  circumstance  leads  us  to  a  second </p><p>objection  which  must  be  raised  against  the  ap-</p><p>parently  obvious  consideration  of  Section  VI. </p><p>Namely,  if  the  man  in  the  carriage  covers  the </p><p>distance w in a unit of time — measured from the </p><p>train, — then this distance — as measured from the </p><p>embankment — is not necessarily also equal to w. </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>XI </p><p></p><p>THE  LORENTZ  TRANSFORMATION </p><p></p><p>T </p><p></p><p>HE  results  of  the  last  three  sections  show </p><p>  that  the  apparent  incompatibility  of  the </p><p>  law of propagation of light with the principle </p><p>of  relativity  (Section  VII)  has  been  derived  by </p><p>means  of  a  consideration  which  borrowed  two </p><p>unjustifiable hypotheses from classical mechanics; </p><p>these are as follows: </p><p></p><p>(1) The time-interval (time) between two events </p><p>is independent of the condition of motion </p><p>of the body of reference.  </p><p></p><p>(2) The  space-interval  (distance)  between  two </p><p>points  of  a  rigid  body  is  independent  of </p><p>the  condition  of  motion  of  the  body  of </p><p>reference. </p><p></p><p>If we drop these hypotheses, then the dilemma </p><p>of Section VII disappears, because the theorem of </p><p>the  addition  of  velocities  derived  in  Section  VI </p><p>becomes  invalid.  The  possibility  presents  itself </p><p>that  the  law  of  the  propagation  of  light  in  vacuo </p><p>may be compatible with the principle of relativity, </p><p>and the  question  arises:  How have  we  to modify </p><p>the considerations of Section VI in order to remove </p><p>36 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>THE  LORENTZ  TRANSFORMATION       37 </p><p></p><p>the  apparent  disagreement  between  these  two </p><p>fundamental results of experience? This question </p><p>leads  to  a  general  one.  In  the  discussion  of </p><p>Section  VI  we  have  to  do  with  places  and  times </p><p>relative both to the train and to the embankment. </p><p>How are we to find the place and time of an event </p><p>in  relation  to  the  train,  when  we  know  the  place </p><p>and time of the event with respect to the railway </p><p>embankment?  Is  there  a  thinkable  answer  to  this </p><p>question of such a nature that the law of transmis-</p><p>sion  of  light  in  vacuo  does  not  contradict  the </p><p>principle  of  relativity?  In  other  words:  Can  we </p><p>conceive of a relation between place and time of </p><p>the  individual  events  relative  to  both  reference- </p><p>bodies, such that every ray of light possesses the </p><p>velocity of transmission c relative to the embank-</p><p>ment  and  relative  to  the  train?  This  question </p><p>leads to a quite definite positive answer, and to a </p><p>perfectly definite transformation law for the space- </p><p>time magnitudes of an event when changing over </p><p>from one body of reference to another. </p><p></p><p>Before we deal with this, we shall introduce the </p><p>following  incidental  consideration.  Up  to  the </p><p>present  we  have  only  considered  events  taking </p><p>place  along  the  embankment,  which  had  mathe-</p><p>matically to assume the function of a straight line. </p><p>In  the  manner  indicated  in  Section  II  we  can </p><p>imagine  this  reference-body  supplemented  later-</p><p>ally  and  in  a  vertical  direction  by  means  of  a </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>38      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>framework  of  rods,  so  that  an  event  which  takes </p><p>place  anywhere  can  be  localised  with  reference </p><p>to  this  framework.  Similarly,  we  can  imagine </p><p>the  train  travelling  with  the  velocity  v  to  be </p><p>continued across the whole of space, so that every </p><p>event, no matter how far off it may be, could also </p><p>be localised with respect to the second framework. </p><p>Without  committing  any  fundamental  error,  we </p><p>can disregard the fact that in reality these frame-</p><p>works would continually interfere with each other, </p><p>owing  to  the  impenetrability  of  solid  bodies.  In </p><p>every such framework we imagine three surfaces </p><p>perpendicular  to  each  other  marked  out,  and </p><p>designated  as  “co-ordinate  planes”  (“co-ordinate </p><p>system”).  A  co-ordinate  system  K  then  corre-</p><p>sponds  to  the  embankment,  and  a  co-ordinate </p><p>system  K'  to  the  train.  An  event,  wherever  it </p><p>may  have  taken  place,  would  be  fixed  in  space </p><p>with  respect  to  K  by  the  three  perpendiculars </p><p>x, y, z on the co-ordinate planes, and with regard </p><p>to  time  by  a  time-value  t.  Relative  to  K',  the </p><p>same event would be fixed in respect of space and </p><p>time  by  corresponding  values  x',  y',  z',  t',  which </p><p>of  course  are  not  identical  with  x,  y,  z,  t.  It  has </p><p>already been set forth in detail how these magni-</p><p>tudes  are  to  be  regarded  as  results  of  physical </p><p>measurements.  </p><p></p><p>Obviously  our  problem  can  be  exactly  formu-</p><p>lated  in  the  following  manner.  What  are  the </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>THE  LORENTZ  TRANSFORMATION       39 </p><p></p><p>values  x',  y',  z',  t'  of an  event  with  respect  to  K', </p><p>when the magnitudes x, y, z, t, of the same event </p><p>with  respect  to  K  are  given?  The  relations  must </p><p>be so chosen that the law </p><p>of  the  transmission  of </p><p>light in vacuo is satisfied </p><p>for one and the same  ray </p><p>of  light  (and  of  course  for </p><p>every ray) with respect to </p><p>K  and  K'.    For  the  rela-</p><p>tive  orientation  in  space </p><p>of the co-ordinate systems indicated in the diagram </p><p>(Fig.  2),  this  problem  is  solved  by  means  of  the </p><p>equations: </p><p></p><p>=</p><p></p><p>x'</p><p></p><p>y</p><p>z</p><p></p><p>t</p><p></p><p>=</p><p>=</p><p></p><p>y'</p><p>z'</p><p></p><p>=</p><p></p><p>t'</p><p></p><p>x</p><p></p><p>1</p><p></p><p>vt</p><p>v</p><p>c</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>v</p><p>2</p><p>c</p><p></p><p>1</p><p></p><p>.</p><p></p><p>x</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>v</p><p>c</p><p></p><p>This system of equations is known as the “Lorentz </p><p>transformation.” 1 </p><p></p><p>If in place of the law of transmission of light we </p><p>had  taken  as  our  basis  the  tacit  assumptions  of </p><p>the  older  mechanics  as  to  the  absolute  character </p><p>1 A  simple  derivation  of  the  Lorentz  transformation  is  given  in </p><p></p><p>Appendix I. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>-</p><p>(cid:215)</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>40      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>vt</p><p></p><p>x'</p><p>y'</p><p>z'</p><p>t'</p><p></p><p>of times and lengths, then instead of the above we </p><p>should have obtained the following equations: </p><p>=</p><p>=</p><p>=</p><p>=</p><p></p><p>x</p><p>y</p><p>z</p><p>.t</p><p>This  system  of  equations  is  often  termed  the </p><p>“Galilei transformation.” The Galilei transforma-</p><p>tion  can  be  obtained  from  the  Lorentz  trans-</p><p>formation by substituting an infinitely large value </p><p>for  the  velocity  of  light  c  in  the  latter  trans-</p><p>formation.  </p><p></p><p>Aided  by  the  following  illustration,  we  can </p><p>readily  see  that,  in  accordance  with  the  Lorentz </p><p>transformation,  the  law  of  the  transmission  of </p><p>light  in  vacuo  is  satisfied  both  for  the  reference- </p><p>body  K  and  for  the  reference-body  K'.  A  light- </p><p>signal  is  sent  along  the  positive  x-axis,  and  this </p><p>light-stimulus  advances  in  accordance  with  the </p><p>equation </p><p></p><p>x = ct, </p><p>i.e. with the velocity c. According to the equations </p><p>of  the  Lorentz  transformation,  this  simple  rela-</p><p>tion between x and t involves a relation between </p><p>x'  and  t'.  In  point  of  fact,  if  we  substitute  for </p><p>x the value ct in the first and fourth equations of </p><p>the Lorentz transformation, we obtain: </p><p></p><p>(</p><p></p><p>=</p><p></p><p>x'</p><p></p><p>)</p><p>tvc</p><p>2</p><p></p><p>1</p><p></p><p>v</p><p>c</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p> </p><p></p><p>THE  LORENTZ  TRANSFORMATION       41 </p><p></p><p>(</p><p></p><p>1</p><p></p><p>=</p><p></p><p>t'</p><p></p><p>1</p><p></p><p>)</p><p></p><p>t</p><p></p><p>v</p><p>c</p><p>v</p><p>c</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>,</p><p></p><p>from which, by division, the expression  </p><p></p><p>x' = ct' </p><p>immediately follows.

The  same  result  is  obtained  for </p><p>rays  of  light  advancing  in  any  other  direction </p><p>whatsoever.

But,  on  the  other  hand,  these  results </p><p>must  strike  you  as  being  very  singular,  and  for </p><p>that  reason  I  shall  now  draw  another  conclusion </p><p>from the theory, one which can easily be derived </p><p>from the foregoing considerations, and which has </p><p>been most elegantly confirmed by experiment.  </p><p></p><p>In  Section  VI  we  derived  the  theorem  of  the </p><p>addition of velocities in one direction in the form </p><p>which also results from the hypotheses of classical </p><p>mechanics.  This  theorem  can  also  be  deduced </p><p>readily  from  the  Galilei  transformation  (Section </p><p>XI).  In  place  of  the  man  walking  inside  the </p><p>carriage,  we  introduce  a  point  moving  relatively </p><p>to  the  co-ordinate  system  K'  in  accordance  with </p><p>the equation </p><p></p><p>x' = wt'. </p><p>By means of the first and fourth equations of the </p><p>45 </p><p></p><p> </p><p>  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>46      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>Galilei  transformation  we  can  express  x'  and  t' </p><p>in terms of x and t, and we then obtain </p><p></p><p>x = (v + w)t. </p><p>This equation expresses nothing else than the law </p><p>of motion of the point with reference to the system </p><p>K (of the man with reference to the embankment). </p><p>We denote this velocity by the symbol W, and we </p><p>then obtain, as in Section VI, </p><p>W  =  v + w </p><p></p><p>.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  (A). </p><p>But we can carry out this consideration just as </p><p>well  on  the  basis  of  the  theory  of  relativity.  In </p><p>the equation </p><p></p><p>x' = wt' </p><p>we must then express x' and t' in terms of x and t, </p><p>making use of the first and fourth equations of the </p><p>Lorentz  transformation.

The question now arises as to which </p><p>of these two theorems is the better in accord with </p><p>experience.  On  this  point  we  are  enlightened  by </p><p>a  most  important  experiment  which  the  brilliant </p><p>physicist  Fizeau  performed  more  than  half  a </p><p>century  ago,  and  which  has  been  repeated  since </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>THE  EXPERIMENT  OF  FIZEAU           47 </p><p></p><p>then by some of the best experimental physicists, </p><p>so  that  there  can  be  no  doubt  about  its  result. </p><p>The  experiment  is  concerned  with  the  following </p><p>question.  Light  travels  in  a  motionless  liquid </p><p>with  a  particular  velocity  w.  How  quickly  does </p><p>it travel in the direction of the arrow in the tube T </p><p>(see the accompanying diagram, Fig. 3) when the </p><p>liquid  above  mentioned  is  flowing  through  the </p><p>tube with a velocity v?  </p><p></p><p>In  accordance  with  the  principle  of  relativity </p><p>we  shall  certainly  have  to  take  for  granted  that </p><p>the  propagation  of  light  always  takes  place  with </p><p>the  same  velocity  w  with  respect  to  the  liquid, </p><p>whether  the  latter  is  in  motion  with  reference  to </p><p>other bodies or not. The velocity of light relative </p><p>to the liquid and the velocity of the latter relative </p><p>to  the  tube  are  thus  known,  and  we  require  the </p><p>velocity of light relative to the tube. </p><p></p><p>It is clear that we have the problem of Section </p><p>VI  again  before  us.  The  tube  plays  the  part  of </p><p></p><p>the  railway  embankment  or  of  the  co-ordinate </p><p>system K, the liquid plays the part of the carriage </p><p>or  of  the  co-ordinate  system  K',  and  finally,  the </p><p>light plays the part of the man walking along the </p><p>carriage,  or  of  the  moving  point  in  the  present </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>48      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>section.  If  we  denote  the  velocity  of  the  light </p><p>relative  to  the  tube  by  W,  then  this  is  given  by </p><p>the  equation  (A)  or  (B),  according  as  the  Galilei </p><p>transformation  or  the  Lorentz  transformation </p><p>corresponds to the  facts.  Experiment 1 decides in </p><p>favour of equation (B) derived from the theory of </p><p>relativity,  and  the  agreement  is,  indeed,  very </p><p>exact.  According  to  recent  and  most  excellent </p><p>measurements  by  Zeeman,  the  influence  of  the </p><p>velocity  of  flow  v  on  the  propagation  of  light </p><p>is  represented  by  formula  (B)  to  within  one </p><p>per cent.  </p><p></p><p>Nevertheless  we  must  now  draw  attention  to </p><p>the  fact  that  a  theory  of  this  phenomenon  was </p><p>given by H. A. Lorentz long before the statement </p><p>of  the  theory  of  relativity.  This  theory  was  of  a </p><p>purely electrodynamical nature, and was obtained </p><p>by  the  use  of  particular  hypotheses  as  to  the </p><p>electromagnetic structure of matter. This circum-</p><p>stance,  however,  does  not  in  the  least  diminish </p><p>the conclusiveness of the experiment as a crucial </p><p>test  in  favour  of  the  theory  of  relativity,  for  the </p><p></p><p>1 Fizeau found </p><p></p><p>vwW</p><p></p><p>+</p><p></p><p>=</p><p></p><p>(</p><p></p><p>1</p><p></p><p>)</p><p></p><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>n</p><p></p><p>, where </p><p></p><p>n =</p><p></p><p>c</p><p>w</p><p></p><p> is the index </p><p></p><p>of  refraction  of  the  liquid.  On  the  other  hand,  owing  to  the  small-</p><p>vw  as compared with 1, we can replace (B) in the first place </p><p>2c</p><p></p><p>ness of </p><p></p><p>)</p><p></p><p>vw</p><p>2</p><p>c</p><p></p><p>, or to the same order of approximation by </p><p></p><p>by </p><p></p><p>W</p><p></p><p>=</p><p></p><p>(</p><p></p><p>+</p><p>vw</p><p></p><p>(</p><p></p><p>1</p><p></p><p>+</p><p>vw</p><p></p><p>1</p><p></p><p>()</p><p>)</p><p></p><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>n</p><p></p><p>, which agrees with Fizeau’s result. </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p></p><p>THE  EXPERIMENT  OF  FIZEAU           49 </p><p></p><p>electrodynamics of Maxwell-Lorentz, on which the </p><p>original theory was based, in no way opposes the </p><p>theory  of  relativity.  Rather  has  the  latter  been </p><p>developed from electrodynamics as an astoundingly </p><p>simple  combination  and  generalisation  of  the </p><p>hypotheses,  formerly  independent  of  each  other, </p><p>on which electrodynamics was built. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>XIV </p><p></p><p>THE  HEURISTIC  VALUE  OF  THE  THEORY  OF </p><p>RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>O </p><p></p><p>UR train of thought in the foregoing pages </p><p>  can be epitomised in the following manner. </p><p>  Experience has led to the conviction that, </p><p>on the  one hand, the  principle of  relativity  holds </p><p>true,  and  that  on  the  other  hand  the  velocity  of </p><p>transmission of light in vacuo has to be considered </p><p>equal to a constant c. By uniting these two postu-</p><p>lates  we  obtained  the  law  of  transformation  for </p><p>the  rectangular  co-ordinates  x,  y,  z  and  the  time </p><p>t  of  the  events  which  constitute  the  processes  of </p><p>nature.  In  this  connection  we  did  not  obtain </p><p>the  Galilei  transformation,  but,  differing  from </p><p>classical mechanics, the Lorentz transformation.  </p><p>The law of transmission of light, the acceptance </p><p>of  which  is  justified  by  our  actual  knowledge, </p><p>played an important part in this process of thought. </p><p>Once in possession of the Lorentz transformation, </p><p>however, we can combine this with the principle </p><p>of relativity, and sum up the theory thus:  </p><p></p><p>Every  general  law  of  nature  must  be  so  con-</p><p>stituted  that  it  is  transformed  into  a  law  of </p><p>exactly the same form when, instead of the space- </p><p>50 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>HEURISTIC  VALUE  OF  RELATIVITY      51 </p><p></p><p>time variables x, y, z, t of the original co-ordinate </p><p>system K, we introduce new space-time variables </p><p>x',  y',  z',  t'  of  a  co-ordinate  system  K'.  In  this </p><p>connection the relation between the ordinary and </p><p>the  accented  magnitudes  is  given  by  the  Lorentz </p><p>transformation.  Or,  in  brief:  General  laws  of </p><p>nature  are  co-variant  with  respect  to  Lorentz </p><p>transformations.  </p><p></p><p>This  is  a  definite  mathematical  condition  that </p><p>the theory of relativity demands of a natural law, </p><p>and in virtue of this, the theory becomes a valuable </p><p>heuristic  aid  in  the  search  for  general  laws  of </p><p>nature. If a general law of nature were to be found </p><p>which did not satisfy this condition, then at least </p><p>one  of  the  two  fundamental  assumptions  of  the </p><p>theory  would  have  been  disproved.  Let  us  now </p><p>examine  what  general  results  the  latter  theory </p><p>has hitherto evinced. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>XV </p><p></p><p>GENERAL  RESULTS  OF  THE  THEORY </p><p></p><p>I </p><p></p><p>T is clear from our previous considerations that </p><p>  the  (special)  theory  of  relativity  has  grown </p><p>  out  of  electrodynamics  and  optics.  In  these </p><p>fields it has not appreciably altered the predictions </p><p>of  theory,  but  it  has  considerably  simplified  the </p><p>theoretical  structure,  i.e.  the  derivation  of  laws, </p><p>and — what is incomparably more important — it </p><p>has  considerably  reduced  the  number  of  inde-</p><p>pendent  hypotheses  forming  the  basis  of  theory. </p><p>The  special  theory  of  relativity  has  rendered  the </p><p>Maxwell-Lorentz  theory  so  plausible,  that  the </p><p>latter  would  have  been  generally  accepted  by </p><p>physicists  even  if  experiment  had  decided  less </p><p>unequivocally in its favour.  </p><p></p><p>Classical  mechanics  required  to  be  modified </p><p>before  it  could  come  into  line  with  the  demands </p><p>of  the  special  theory  of  relativity.  For  the  main </p><p>part,  however,  this  modification  affects  only  the </p><p>laws for rapid motions, in which the velocities of </p><p>matter v are not very small as compared with the </p><p>velocity  of  light.  We  have  experience  of  such </p><p>rapid  motions  only  in  the  case  of  electrons  and </p><p>52 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>GENERAL  RESULTS  OF  THEORY         53 </p><p></p><p>ions;  for  other  motions  the  variations  from  the </p><p>laws of classical mechanics are too small to make </p><p>themselves  evident  in  practice.  We  shall  not </p><p>consider  the  motion  of  stars  until  we  come  to </p><p>speak  of  the  general  theory  of  relativity.  In </p><p>accordance  with  the  theory  of  relativity  the </p><p>kinetic energy of a material point of mass m is no </p><p>longer given by the well-known expression </p><p></p><p>but by the expression </p><p></p><p>2vm</p><p>2</p><p></p><p>,</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>mc</p><p></p><p>.* </p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>1</p><p></p><p>v</p><p>c</p><p>This expression approaches infinity as the velocity </p><p>v approaches the velocity of light c. The velocity </p><p>must therefore always remain less than c, however </p><p>great  may  be  the  energies  used  to  produce  the </p><p>acceleration.  If  we  develop  the  expression  for </p><p>the  kinetic  energy  in  the  form  of  a  series,  we </p><p>obtain </p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>mc</p><p></p><p>+</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>vm</p><p>2</p><p></p><p>+</p><p></p><p>3</p><p>8</p><p></p><p>vm</p><p>c</p><p></p><p>4</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>+</p><p>.   .   .   .  </p><p></p><p>When </p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>v  is small compared with unity, the third </p><p>c</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>of these terms is always small in comparison with </p><p>the second, which last is alone considered in classi-</p><p>2mc  does not contain </p><p>cal mechanics.

Before </p><p>the  advent  of  relativity,  physics  recognised  two </p><p>conservation  laws  of  fundamental  importance, </p><p>namely,  the  law  of  the  conservation  of  energy </p><p>and  the  law  of  the  conservation  of  mass;  these </p><p>two  fundamental  laws  appeared  to  be  quite  in-</p><p>dependent  of  each  other.  By  means  of  the </p><p>theory of relativity they have been united into one </p><p>law.  We  shall  now  briefly  consider  how  this </p><p>unification  came  about,  and  what  meaning  is  to </p><p>be attached to it.  </p><p></p><p>The principle of relativity requires that the law </p><p>of  the  conservation  of  energy  should  hold  not </p><p>only  with  reference  to  a  co-ordinate  system  K, </p><p>but also with respect to every co-ordinate system </p><p>K' which is in a state of uniform motion of transla-</p><p>tion  relative  to  K,  or,  briefly,  relative  to  every </p><p>“Galileian”  system  of  co-ordinates.  In  contrast </p><p>to classical mechanics, the Lorentz transformation </p><p>is  the  deciding  factor  in  the  transition  from  one </p><p>such system to another.  </p><p></p><p>By  means  of  comparatively  simple  considera-</p><p>tions we are led to draw the following conclusion </p><p>from  these  premises,  in  conjunction  with  the </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>GENERAL  RESULTS  OF  THEORY         55 </p><p></p><p>fundamental  equations  of  the  electrodynamics  of </p><p>Maxwell:  A  body  moving  with  the  velocity  v, </p><p>which  absorbs 1  an  amount  of  energy </p><p>0E   in  the </p><p>form  of  radiation  without  suffering  an  alteration </p><p>in velocity in the process, has, as a consequence, </p><p>its energy increased by an amount </p><p></p><p>* </p><p></p><p>.</p><p></p><p>E</p><p></p><p>0</p><p></p><p>1</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>v</p><p>c</p><p></p><p>In consideration of the expression given above </p><p>for  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  body,  the  required </p><p>energy of the body comes out to be </p><p>(</p><p>m</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>+ )</p><p>E</p><p>0</p><p>c</p><p>2</p><p>c</p><p>v</p><p>c</p><p></p><p>1</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>.</p><p></p><p>Thus  the  body  has  the  same  energy  as  a  body </p><p></p><p>of  mass </p><p></p><p>(</p><p>m +</p><p></p><p>)</p><p></p><p>E</p><p>0</p><p>2</p><p>c</p><p></p><p>  moving  with  the  velocity  v. </p><p></p><p>Hence we can say: If a body takes up an amount </p><p>0E , then its inertial mass increases by an </p><p>of energy </p><p>E</p><p>0</p><p>2</p><p>c</p><p></p><p>;  the  inertial  mass  of  a  body  is  not  a </p><p></p><p>amount </p><p></p><p>constant,  but  varies  according  to  the  change  in </p><p>the  energy  of  the  body.

According to the theory of relativity, </p><p>action  at  a  distance  with  the  velocity  of  light </p><p>always  takes the place  of instantaneous  action  at </p><p>a  distance  or  of  action  at  a  distance  with  an  in-</p><p>finite velocity  of  transmission.  This  is  connected </p><p>with  the  fact  that  the  velocity  c  plays  a  funda-</p><p>mental rôle in this theory. In Part II we shall see </p><p>in  what  way  this  result  becomes  modified  in  the </p><p>general theory of relativity. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>XVI </p><p></p><p>EXPERIENCE  AND  THE  SPECIAL  THEORY </p><p>OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>T </p><p></p><p>O  what  extent is  the special theory  of  rela-</p><p>  tivity supported by experience? This ques-</p><p>  tion  is  not  easily  answered  for  the  reason </p><p>already  mentioned  in  connection  with the  funda-</p><p>mental  experiment  of  Fizeau.  The  special  theory </p><p>of relativity has crystallised out from the Maxwell- </p><p>Lorentz  theory  of  electromagnetic  phenomena. </p><p>Thus  all  facts  of  experience  which  support  the </p><p>electromagnetic theory also support the theory of </p><p>relativity.  As  being  of  particular  importance,  I </p><p>mention here the fact that the theory of relativity </p><p>enables  us to  predict  the  effects  produced  on the </p><p>light  reaching  us  from  the  fixed  stars.  These </p><p>results  are  obtained  in  an  exceedingly  simple </p><p>manner,  and  the  effects indicated,  which are  due </p><p>to the relative motion of the earth with reference </p><p>to  those  fixed  stars,  are  found  to  be  in  accord </p><p>with  experience.  We  refer  to  the  yearly  move-</p><p>ment  of  the  apparent  position  of  the  fixed  stars </p><p>resulting  from  the  motion  of  the  earth  round  the </p><p>sun (aberration), and to the influence of the radial </p><p>58 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>EXPERIENCE  AND  RELATIVITY          59 </p><p></p><p>components  of  the  relative  motions  of  the  fixed </p><p>stars  with  respect  to  the  earth  on  the  colour  of </p><p>the light reaching us from them. The latter effect </p><p>manifests  itself  in  a  slight  displacement  of  the </p><p>spectral  lines  of  the  light  transmitted  to  us  from </p><p>a fixed star, as compared with the position of the </p><p>same spectral lines when they are produced by a </p><p>terrestrial  source  of  light  (Doppler  principle). </p><p>The  experimental  arguments  in  favour  of  the </p><p>Maxwell-Lorentz  theory,  which  are  at  the  same </p><p>time  arguments  in  favour  of  the  theory  of  rela-</p><p>tivity,  are  too  numerous  to  be  set  forth  here.  In </p><p>reality  they  limit  the  theoretical  possibilities  to </p><p>such  an  extent,  that  no  other  theory  than  that  of </p><p>Maxwell  and  Lorentz  has  been  able  to  hold  its </p><p>own when tested by experience.  </p><p></p><p>But there are two classes of experimental facts </p><p>hitherto obtained which can be represented in the </p><p>Maxwell-Lorentz theory only by the introduction </p><p>of  an  auxiliary  hypothesis,  which  in  itself — i.e. </p><p>without making use of the theory of relativity —</p><p>appears extraneous.  </p><p></p><p>It is known that cathode rays and the so-called </p><p>b -rays  emitted  by  radioactive  substances  consist </p><p>of  negatively  electrified  particles  (electrons)  of </p><p>very small inertia and large velocity. By examin-</p><p>ing the deflection of these rays under the influence </p><p>of electric and magnetic fields, we can study the </p><p>law of motion of these particles very exactly. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>60      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>In  the  theoretical  treatment  of  these  electrons, </p><p>we  are  faced  with  the  difficulty  that  electro-</p><p>dynamic  theory  of  itself  is  unable  to  give  an  ac-</p><p>count  of  their  nature.  For  since  electrical  masses </p><p>of one sign repel each other, the negative electrical </p><p>masses constituting the electron would necessarily </p><p>be  scattered  under  the  influence  of  their  mutual </p><p>repulsions, unless there are forces of another kind </p><p>operating between them, the nature of which has </p><p>hitherto  remained  obscure  to  us.1  If  we  now </p><p>assume  that  the  relative  distances  between  the </p><p>electrical masses constituting the electron remain </p><p>unchanged  during  the  motion  of  the  electron </p><p>(rigid  connection  in  the  sense  of  classical  me-</p><p>chanics),  we  arrive  at  a  law  of  motion  of  the </p><p>electron  which  does  not  agree  with  experience. </p><p>Guided  by  purely  formal  points  of  view,  H.  A. </p><p>Lorentz  was  the  first  to  introduce  the  hypothesis </p><p>that  the  particles  constituting  the  electron  ex-</p><p>perience  a  contraction  in  the  direction  of  motion </p><p>in consequence of that motion, the amount of this </p><p>contraction  being  proportional  to  the  expression </p><p></p><p>1</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>v-</p><p>c</p><p></p><p>.* This hypothesis, which is not justifiable </p><p></p><p>by  any  electrodynamical  facts,  supplies  us  then </p><p>with that particular law of motion which has been </p><p>confirmed with great precision in recent years. </p><p></p><p>1 The  general  theory  of  relativity  renders  it  likely  that  the  elec-</p><p>trical masses of an electron are held together by gravitational forces. </p><p></p><p>[* </p><p></p><p>1</p><p></p><p>v=</p><p>c</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p> — J.M.] </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>EXPERIENCE  AND  RELATIVITY          61 </p><p></p><p>The  theory  of  relativity  leads  to  the  same  law </p><p>of motion, without requiring any special hypothe-</p><p>sis  whatsoever  as  to  the  structure  and  the  be-</p><p>haviour  of  the  electron.  We  arrived  at  a  similar </p><p>conclusion in Section XIII in connection with the </p><p>experiment of Fizeau, the result of which is fore-</p><p>told  by  the  theory  of  relativity  without  the  ne-</p><p>cessity of drawing on hypotheses as to the physical </p><p>nature of the liquid.  </p><p></p><p>The  second  class  of  facts  to  which  we  have </p><p>alluded  has  reference  to  the  question  whether  or </p><p>not the motion of the earth in space can be made </p><p>perceptible  in  terrestrial  experiments.  We  have </p><p>already  remarked  in  Section  V  that  all  attempts </p><p>of  this  nature  led  to  a  negative  result.  Before </p><p>the  theory  of  relativity  was  put  forward,  it  was </p><p>difficult  to  become  reconciled  to  this  negative </p><p>result,  for  reasons  now  to  be  discussed.  The  in-</p><p>herited  prejudices  about  time  and  space  did  not </p><p>allow any doubt to arise as to the prime importance </p><p>of  the  Galilei  transformation  for  changing  over </p><p>from  one  body  of  reference  to  another.  Now </p><p>assuming  that  the  Maxwell-Lorentz  equations </p><p>hold  for  a  reference-body  K,  we  then  find  that </p><p>they do not hold for a reference-body K' moving </p><p>uniformly  with  respect  to  K,  if  we  assume  that </p><p>the  relations  of  the  Galileian  transformation </p><p>exist  between  the  co-ordinates  of  K  and  K'.  It </p><p>thus  appears  that  of  all  Galileian  co-ordinate </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>62      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>systems  one  (K)  corresponding  to  a  particular </p><p>state  of  motion  is  physically  unique.  This  result </p><p>was  interpreted  physically  by  regarding  K  as  at </p><p>rest with respect to a hypothetical æther of space. </p><p>On  the  other  hand,  all  co-ordinate  systems  K' </p><p>moving relatively to K were to be regarded as in </p><p>motion with respect to the æther. To this motion </p><p>of  K'  against  the  æther  (“æther-drift”  relative  to </p><p>K')  were  assigned  the  more  complicated  laws </p><p>which  were  supposed  to  hold  relative  to  K'. </p><p>Strictly  speaking,  such  an  æther-drift  ought  also </p><p>to  be  assumed  relative  to  the  earth,  and  for  a </p><p>long  time  the  efforts  of  physicists  were  devoted </p><p>to  attempts  to  detect  the  existence  of  an  æther- </p><p>drift at the earth’s surface.  </p><p></p><p>In  one  of  the  most  notable  of  these  attempts </p><p>Michelson  devised  a  method  which  appears  as </p><p>though  it  must  be  decisive.  Imagine  two  mirrors </p><p>so  arranged  on  a  rigid  body  that  the  reflecting </p><p>surfaces  face  each  other.  A  ray  of  light  requires </p><p>a perfectly definite time T to pass from one mirror </p><p>to  the  other  and  back  again,  if  the  whole  system </p><p>be  at  rest  with  respect  to  the  æther.  It  is  found </p><p>by  calculation,  however,  that  a  slightly  different </p><p>time  T'  is  required  for  this  process,  if  the  body, </p><p>together  with  the  mirrors,  be  moving  relatively </p><p>to  the  æther.  And  yet  another  point:  it  is  shown </p><p>by  calculation  that  for  a  given  velocity  v  with </p><p>reference  to  the  æther,  this  time  T'  is  different </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>EXPERIENCE  AND  RELATIVITY          63 </p><p></p><p>when  the  body  is  moving  perpendicularly  to  the </p><p>planes  of  the  mirrors  from  that  resulting  when </p><p>the  motion  is  parallel  to  these  planes.  Although </p><p>the estimated difference between these two times </p><p>is  exceedingly  small,  Michelson  and  Morley </p><p>performed  an  experiment  involving  interference </p><p>in which this difference should have been clearly </p><p>detectable.  But  the  experiment  gave  a  negative </p><p>result — a  fact  very  perplexing  to  physicists. </p><p>Lorentz  and  FitzGerald  rescued  the  theory  from </p><p>this  difficulty  by  assuming  that  the  motion  of </p><p>the body relative to the æther produces a contrac-</p><p>tion  of  the  body  in  the  direction  of  motion,  the </p><p>amount  of  contraction  being  just  sufficient  to </p><p>compensate  for  the difference  in  time  mentioned </p><p>above. Comparison with the discussion in Section </p><p>XII  shows  that  from  the  standpoint  also  of  the </p><p>theory  of  relativity  this  solution  of  the  difficulty </p><p>was the right one. But on the basis of the theory </p><p>of  relativity  the  method  of  interpretation  is  in-</p><p>comparably  more  satisfactory.  According  to  this </p><p>theory  there  is  no  such  thing  as  a  “specially </p><p>favoured” (unique) co-ordinate system to occasion </p><p>the  introduction  of  the  æther-idea,  and  hence </p><p>there  can  be  no  æther-drift,  nor  any  experiment </p><p>with  which  to  demonstrate  it.  Here  the  contrac-</p><p>tion of moving bodies follows from the two fun-</p><p>damental  principles  of  the  theory  without  the </p><p>introduction  of  particular  hypotheses;  and  as  the </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>64      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>prime factor involved in this contraction we find, </p><p>not  the  motion  in  itself,  to  which  we  cannot </p><p>attach  any  meaning,  but  the  motion  with  respect </p><p>to  the  body  of  reference  chosen  in  the  particular </p><p>case  in  point.  Thus  for  a  co-ordinate  system </p><p>moving  with  the  earth  the  mirror  system  of </p><p>Michelson  and  Morley  is  not  shortened,  but  it  is </p><p>shortened  for  a  co-ordinate  system  which  is  at </p><p>rest relatively to the sun. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>XVII </p><p></p><p>MINKOWSKI’S  FOUR–DIMENSIONAL  SPACE </p><p></p><p>T </p><p></p><p>HE  non-mathematician  is  seized  by  a  mys-</p><p>  terious shuddering when he hears of “four-</p><p>  dimensional” things, by a feeling not unlike </p><p>that  awakened  by  thoughts  of  the  occult.  And </p><p>yet there is no more common-place statement than </p><p>that  the  world  in  which  we  live  is  a  four-dimen-</p><p>sional space-time continuum.  </p><p></p><p>Space  is  a  three-dimensional  continuum.  By </p><p>this  we  mean  that  it  is  possible  to  describe  the </p><p>position  of  a  point  (at  rest)  by  means  of  three </p><p>numbers  (co-ordinates)  x,  y,  z,  and  that  there  is </p><p>an  indefinite  number  of  points  in  the  neighbour-</p><p>hood  of  this  one,  the  position  of  which  can  be </p><p>described by co-ordinates such as x1, y1, z1, which </p><p>may  be  as  near  as  we  choose  to  the  respective </p><p>values of the co-ordinates x, y, z of the first point. </p><p>In  virtue  of  the  latter  property  we  speak  of  a </p><p>“continuum,”  and  owing  to  the  fact  that  there </p><p>are  three  co-ordinates  we  speak  of  it  as  being </p><p>“three-dimensional.”  </p><p></p><p>Similarly,  the  world  of  physical  phenomena </p><p>which  was  briefly  called  “world”  by  Minkowski </p><p>65 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>66      SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>is  naturally  four-dimensional  in  the  space-time </p><p>sense.  For  it  is  composed  of  individual  events, </p><p>each  of  which  is  described  by  four  numbers, </p><p>namely,  three  space  co-ordinates  x,  y,  z  and  a </p><p>time  co-ordinate,  the  time-value  t.  The  “world” </p><p>is  in  this  sense  also  a  continuum;  for  to  every </p><p>event  there  are  as  many  “neighbouring”  events </p><p>(realised  or  at  least  thinkable)  as  we  care  to </p><p>choose, the co-ordinates x1, y1, z1, t1 of which differ </p><p>by an indefinitely small amount from those of the </p><p>event  x,  y,  z,  t  originally  considered.  That  we </p><p>have  not  been  accustomed  to  regard  the  world </p><p>in  this  sense  as  a  four-dimensional  continuum  is </p><p>due  to the  fact that in physics, before the  advent </p><p>of the theory of relativity, time played a different </p><p>and  more  independent  rôle,  as  compared  with </p><p>the  space  co-ordinates.  It  is  for  this  reason  that </p><p>we  have  been  in  the  habit  of  treating  time  as  an </p><p>independent  continuum.  As  a  matter  of  fact, </p><p>according to classical mechanics, time is absolute, </p><p>i.e. it is independent of the position and the condi-</p><p>tion of motion of the system of co-ordinates. We </p><p>see  this  expressed  in  the  last  equation  of  the </p><p>Galileian transformation (t' = t). </p><p></p><p>The four-dimensional mode of consideration of </p><p>the “world” is natural on the theory of relativity, </p><p>since according to this theory time is robbed of its </p><p>independence.

Pure  “space-distance”  of  two  events </p><p>with  respect  to  K  results  in  “time-distance”  of </p><p>the  same  events  with  respect  to  K'.  But  the </p><p>discovery of Minkowski, which was of importance </p><p>for the formal development of the theory of rela-</p><p>tivity,  does  not  lie  here.  It  is  to  be  found  rather </p><p>in the fact of his recognition that the four-dimen-</p><p>sional space-time continuum of the theory of rela-</p><p>tivity,  in  its  most  essential  formal  properties, </p><p>shows  a  pronounced  relationship  to  the  three- </p><p>dimensional continuum of Euclidean geometrical </p><p>space.1  In  order  to  give  due  prominence  to  this </p><p>relationship, however, we  must replace the usual </p><p>time  co-ordinate  t  by  an  imaginary  magnitude </p><p>  proportional  to  it.  Under  these  condi-</p><p>tions,  the  natural  laws  satisfying  the  demands  of </p><p>the  (special)  theory  of  relativity  assume  mathe-</p><p>matical forms, in which the time co-ordinate plays </p><p>exactly  the  same  rôle  as  the  three  space  co- </p><p>these  four  co-ordinates </p><p>ordinates.

Min-</p><p>kowski’s  work  is  doubtless  difficult  of  access  to </p><p>anyone  inexperienced  in  mathematics,  but  since </p><p>it  is  not  necessary  to  have  a  very  exact  grasp  of </p><p>this work in order to understand the fundamental </p><p>ideas of either the special or the general theory of </p><p>relativity,  I  shall  at  present  leave  it  here,  and </p><p>shall  revert to it only  towards the  end  of Part  II. </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>P A R T  I I </p><p>THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>XVIII </p><p></p><p>SPECIAL  AND  GENERAL  PRINCIPLE  OF </p><p>RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>T </p><p></p><p>HE basal principle, which was the pivot of all </p><p>  our previous considerations, was the special </p><p>  principle  of  relativity,  i.e.  the  principle  of </p><p>the physical  relativity  of  all uniform  motion.  Let </p><p>us once more analyse its meaning carefully.  </p><p></p><p>It was at all times clear that, from the point of </p><p>view  of  the  idea  it  conveys  to  us,  every  motion </p><p>must  only  be  considered  as  a  relative  motion. </p><p>Returning  to  the  illustration  we  have  frequently </p><p>used of the embankment and the railway carriage, </p><p>we can express the fact of the motion here taking </p><p>place  in  the  following  two  forms,  both  of  which </p><p>are equally justifiable: </p><p></p><p>(a) The  carriage  is  in  motion  relative  to  the </p><p></p><p>embankment.  </p><p></p><p>(b) The  embankment  is  in  motion  relative  to </p><p></p><p>the carriage.  </p><p></p><p>In  (a)  the  embankment,  in  (b)  the  carriage, </p><p>serves  as  the  body  of  reference  in  our  statement </p><p>69 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>70     GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>of  the  motion  taking  place.  If  it  is  simply  a </p><p>question of detecting or of describing the motion </p><p>involved,  it  is  in  principle  immaterial  to  what </p><p>reference-body  we  refer  the  motion.  As  already </p><p>mentioned, this is self-evident, but it must not be </p><p>confused with the much more comprehensive state-</p><p>ment called “the principle of relativity,” which we </p><p>have taken as the basis of our investigations.  </p><p></p><p>The  principle  we  have  made  use  of  not  only </p><p>maintains  that  we  may  equally  well  choose  the </p><p>carriage or the embankment as our reference-body </p><p>for  the  description  of  any  event  (for  this,  too,  is </p><p>self-evident).  Our  principle  rather  asserts  what </p><p>follows:  If  we  formulate  the  general  laws  of </p><p>nature  as  they  are  obtained  from  experience,  by </p><p>making use of  </p><p></p><p>(a) the embankment as reference-body,  </p><p>(b) the railway carriage as reference-body,  </p><p></p><p>then these general laws of nature (e.g. the laws of </p><p>mechanics  or  the  law  of  the  propagation  of  light </p><p>in vacuo) have exactly the same form in both cases. </p><p>This  can  also  be  expressed  as  follows:  For  the </p><p>physical  description  of  natural  processes,  neither </p><p>of  the  reference-bodies  K,  K'  is  unique  (lit. </p><p>“specially  marked  out”)  as  compared  with  the </p><p>other.  Unlike  the  first,  this  latter  statement  need </p><p>not of necessity hold a priori; it is not contained </p><p>in  the  conceptions  of  “motion”  and  “reference- </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SPECIAL  AND  GENERAL  PRINCIPLE     71 </p><p></p><p>body”  and derivable from  them;  only  experience </p><p>can decide as to its correctness or incorrectness.  </p><p>Up  to  the  present,  however,  we  have  by  no </p><p>means  maintained  the  equivalence  of  all  bodies </p><p>of reference K in connection with the formulation </p><p>of  natural  laws.  Our  course  was  more  on  the </p><p>following  lines.  In  the  first  place,  we  started  out </p><p>from the assumption that there exists a reference- </p><p>body  K,  whose  condition  of  motion  is  such  that </p><p>the  Galileian  law  holds  with  respect  to  it:  A </p><p>particle left to itself and sufficiently far removed </p><p>from  all  other  particles  moves  uniformly  in  a </p><p>straight  line.  With  reference  to  K  (Galileian </p><p>reference-body)  the laws of nature  were to be  as </p><p>simple  as  possible.  But  in  addition  to  K,  all </p><p>bodies of reference K' should be given preference </p><p>in this sense, and they should be exactly equiva-</p><p>lent  to  K  for  the  formulation  of  natural  laws, </p><p>provided  that  they  are  in  a  state  of  uniform </p><p>rectilinear and non-rotary motion with respect to K; </p><p>all  these  bodies  of  reference  are  to  be  regarded </p><p>as  Galileian  reference-bodies.  The  validity  of </p><p>the  principle  of  relativity  was  assumed  only  for </p><p>these  reference-bodies,  but  not  for  others  (e.g. </p><p>those  possessing  motion  of  a  different  kind).  In </p><p>this  sense  we  speak  of  the  special  principle  of </p><p>relativity, or special theory of relativity.  </p><p></p><p>In  contrast  to  this  we  wish  to  understand  by </p><p>the “general principle of relativity” the following </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>72     GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>statement:  All  bodies  of  reference  K,  K',  etc., </p><p>are  equivalent  for  the  description  of  natural </p><p>phenomena  (formulation  of  the  general  laws  of </p><p>nature),  whatever  may  be  their  state  of  motion. </p><p>But  before  proceeding  farther,  it  ought  to  be </p><p>pointed  out  that  this  formulation  must  be  re-</p><p>placed  later  by  a  more  abstract  one,  for  reasons </p><p>which will become evident at a later stage.  </p><p></p><p>Since  the  introduction  of  the  special  principle </p><p>of  relativity  has  been  justified,  every  intellect </p><p>which  strives  after  generalisation  must  feel  the </p><p>temptation to venture the step towards the general </p><p>principle  of  relativity.  But  a  simple  and  ap-</p><p>parently  quite  reliable  consideration  seems  to </p><p>suggest  that,  for  the  present  at  any  rate,  there  is </p><p>little  hope  of  success  in  such  an  attempt.  Let </p><p>us imagine ourselves transferred to our old friend </p><p>the  railway  carriage,  which  is  travelling  at  a </p><p>uniform  rate.  As  long  as  it  is  moving  uniformly, </p><p>the occupant of the carriage is not sensible of its </p><p>motion,  and  it  is  for  this  reason  that  he  can  un-</p><p>reluctantly  interpret  the  facts  of  the  case  as </p><p>indicating  that  the  carriage  is  at  rest,  but  the </p><p>embankment  in  motion.  Moreover,  according </p><p>to  the  special  principle  of  relativity,  this  inter-</p><p>pretation  is  quite  justified  also  from  a  physical </p><p>point of view.  </p><p></p><p>If  the  motion  of  the  carriage  is  now  changed </p><p>into  a  non-uniform  motion,  as  for  instance  by  a </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SPECIAL  AND  GENERAL  PRINCIPLE     73 </p><p></p><p>powerful  application  of  the  brakes,  then  the  oc-</p><p>cupant  of  the  carriage  experiences  a  correspond-</p><p>ingly  powerful  jerk  forwards.  The  retarded  mo-</p><p>tion  is  manifested  in  the  mechanical  behaviour </p><p>of  bodies  relative  to  the  person  in  the  railway </p><p>carriage.  The  mechanical  behaviour  is  different </p><p>from  that  of  the  case  previously  considered,  and </p><p>for  this  reason  it  would  appear  to  be  impossible </p><p>that  the  same  mechanical  laws  hold  relatively  to </p><p>the  non-uniformly  moving  carriage,  as hold  with </p><p>reference  to  the  carriage  when  at  rest  or  in  uni-</p><p>form  motion.  At  all  events  it  is  clear  that  the </p><p>Galileian  law  does  not  hold  with  respect  to  the </p><p>non-uniformly  moving  carriage.  Because  of  this, </p><p>we feel compelled at the present juncture to grant </p><p>a kind of absolute physical reality to non-uniform </p><p>motion,  in  opposition  to  the  general  principle  of </p><p>relativity.  But  in  what  follows  we  shall  soon </p><p>see that this conclusion cannot be maintained. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>XIX </p><p></p><p>THE  GRAVITATIONAL  FIELD </p><p></p><p>“ I </p><p></p><p>F we pick up a stone and then let it go, why </p><p>  does  it  fall  to  the  ground?”  The  usual </p><p>  answer  to  this  question  is:  “Because  it  is </p><p>attracted  by  the  earth.”  Modern  physics  formu-</p><p>lates the answer rather differently for the follow-</p><p>ing reason. As a result of the more careful study </p><p>of electromagnetic phenomena, we have come to </p><p>regard action at a distance as a process impossible </p><p>without  the  intervention  of  some  intermediary </p><p>medium.  If,  for  instance,  a  magnet  attracts  a </p><p>piece of iron, we cannot be content to regard this </p><p>as  meaning  that  the  magnet  acts  directly  on  the </p><p>iron  through  the  intermediate  empty  space,  but </p><p>we are constrained to imagine — after the manner </p><p>of  Faraday — that </p><p>the  magnet  always  calls </p><p>into being something physically real in the space </p><p>around  it,  that  something  being  what  we  call  a </p><p>“magnetic  field.”  In  its  turn  this  magnetic  field </p><p>operates  on  the  piece  of  iron,  so  that  the  latter </p><p>strives  to  move  towards  the  magnet.  We  shall </p><p>not discuss here the justification for this incidental </p><p>conception,  which  is  indeed  a  somewhat  arbi- </p><p>74 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>THE  GRAVITATIONAL  FIELD             75 </p><p></p><p>trary  one.  We  shall  only  mention  that  with  its </p><p>aid  electromagnetic  phenomena  can  be  theoret-</p><p>ically  represented  much  more  satisfactorily  than </p><p>without  it,  and  this  applies  particularly  to  the </p><p>transmission  of  electromagnetic  waves.  The </p><p>effects  of  gravitation  also  are  regarded  in  an </p><p>analogous manner.  </p><p></p><p>The  action  of  the  earth  on  the  stone  takes </p><p>place  indirectly.  The  earth  produces  in  its  sur-</p><p>roundings a gravitational field, which acts on the </p><p>stone  and  produces  its  motion  of  fall.  As  we </p><p>know from experience, the intensity of the action </p><p>on a body diminishes according to a quite definite </p><p>law, as we proceed farther and farther away from </p><p>the  earth.  From  our  point  of  view  this  means: </p><p>The  law  governing  the  properties  of  the  gravita-</p><p>tional  field  in  space  must  be  a  perfectly  definite </p><p>one, in order correctly to represent the diminution </p><p>of  gravitational  action  with  the  distance  from </p><p>operative  bodies.  It  is  something  like  this:  The </p><p>body (e.g. the earth) produces a field in its imme-</p><p>diate  neighbourhood  directly;  the  intensity  and </p><p>direction  of  the  field  at  points  farther  removed </p><p>from  the  body  are  thence  determined  by  the  law </p><p>which  governs  the  properties  in  space  of  the </p><p>gravitational fields themselves.  </p><p></p><p>In  contrast  to  electric  and  magnetic  fields,  the </p><p>gravitational  field  exhibits  a  most  remarkable </p><p>property,  which  is  of  fundamental  importance </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>76     GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>for what follows. Bodies which are moving under </p><p>the  sole  influence  of  a  gravitational  field receive </p><p>an acceleration, which does not in the least depend </p><p>either on the material or on the physical state of the </p><p>body.  For  instance,  a  piece  of  lead  and  a  piece </p><p>of  wood  fall  in  exactly  the  same  manner  in  a </p><p>gravitational field (in vacuo), when they start off </p><p>from  rest  or  with  the  same  initial  velocity.  This </p><p>law, which holds most accurately, can be expressed </p><p>in  a  different  form  in  the  light  of  the  following </p><p>consideration.  </p><p></p><p>According to Newton’s law of motion, we have </p><p> (Force)  =  (inertial mass) × (acceleration), </p><p>where  the  “inertial  mass”  is  a  characteristic </p><p>constant  of  the  accelerated  body.  If  now  gravi-</p><p>tation  is  the  cause  of  the  acceleration,  we  then </p><p>have </p><p></p><p>(Force)  =  (gravitational mass) × (intensity of the </p><p>gravitational field), </p><p>where  the  “gravitational  mass”  is  likewise  a </p><p>characteristic  constant  for  the  body.  From  these </p><p>two relations follows: </p><p></p><p>(acceleration) = </p><p></p><p>(gravitational mass) </p><p>(inertial mass) </p><p>gravitational field). </p><p></p><p>× (intensity of the </p><p></p><p>If now, as we find from experience, the accelera-</p><p>tion  is  to  be  independent  of  the  nature  and  the </p><p>condition of the body and always the same for a </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>THE  GRAVITATIONAL  FIELD             77 </p><p></p><p>given  gravitational  field,  then  the  ratio  of  the </p><p>gravitational  to  the  inertial  mass  must  likewise </p><p>be  the  same  for  all  bodies.  By  a  suitable  choice </p><p>of  units  we  can  thus  make  this  ratio  equal  to </p><p>unity.  We  then  have  the  following  law:  The </p><p>gravitational mass of a body is equal to its inertial </p><p>mass.  </p><p></p><p>It  is  true  that  this  important  law  had  hitherto </p><p>been  recorded  in  mechanics,  but  it  had  not  been </p><p>interpreted.  A  satisfactory  interpretation  can  be </p><p>obtained only if we recognise the following fact: </p><p>The  same  quality  of  a  body  manifests  itself  ac-</p><p>cording  to  circumstances  as  “inertia”  or  as </p><p>“weight”  (lit.  “heaviness”).  In  the  following </p><p>section  we  shall  show  to  what  extent  this  is </p><p>actually  the  case,  and  how  this  question  is  con-</p><p>nected with the general postulate of relativity.  </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>XX </p><p></p><p>THE  EQUALITY  OF  INERTIAL  AND  GRAVITA-</p><p>TIONAL MASS AS AN ARGUMENT FOR THE </p><p>GENERAL  POSTULATE  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>W </p><p></p><p>E imagine a large portion of empty space, </p><p>  so  far  removed  from  stars  and  other </p><p>  appreciable masses that we have before </p><p>us  approximately  the  conditions  required  by  the </p><p>fundamental  law  of  Galilei.  It  is  then  possible </p><p>to choose a Galileian reference-body for this part </p><p>of  space  (world),  relative  to  which  points  at  rest </p><p>remain  at  rest  and  points  in  motion  continue </p><p>permanently  in  uniform  rectilinear  motion.  As </p><p>reference-body  let  us  imagine  a  spacious  chest </p><p>resembling  a  room  with  an  observer  inside  who </p><p>is  equipped  with  apparatus.  Gravitation  nat-</p><p>urally  does  not  exist  for  this  observer.  He  must </p><p>fasten himself with strings to the floor, otherwise </p><p>the  slightest  impact  against  the  floor  will  cause </p><p>him  to  rise  slowly  towards  the  ceiling  of  the </p><p>room.  </p><p></p><p>To  the  middle  of  the  lid  of  the  chest  is  fixed </p><p>externally  a  hook  with  rope  attached,  and  now  a </p><p>“being”  (what  kind  of  a  being  is  immaterial  to </p><p>78 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>INERTIAL  AND  GRAVITATIONAL  MASS     79 </p><p></p><p>us)  begins  pulling  at  this  with  a  constant  force. </p><p>The  chest  together  with  the  observer  then  begin </p><p>to move “upwards” with a uniformly accelerated </p><p>motion.  In  course  of  time  their  velocity  will </p><p>reach  unheard-of  values — provided  that  we  are </p><p>viewing  all  this  from  another  reference-body </p><p>which is not being pulled with a rope.  </p><p></p><p>But  how  does  the  man  in  the  chest  regard  the </p><p>process?  The  acceleration  of  the  chest  will  be </p><p>transmitted  to  him  by  the  reaction  of  the  floor </p><p>of  the  chest.  He  must  therefore  take  up  this </p><p>pressure by means of his legs if he does not wish </p><p>to be laid out full length on the floor. He is then </p><p>standing  in  the  chest  in  exactly  the same  way  as </p><p>anyone stands in a room of a house on our earth. </p><p>If  he  release  a  body  which  he  previously  had  in </p><p>his  hand,  the  acceleration  of  the  chest  will  no </p><p>longer  be  transmitted  to  this  body,  and  for  this </p><p>reason  the  body  will  approach  the  floor  of  the </p><p>chest  with  an  accelerated  relative  motion.  The </p><p>observer  will  further  convince  himself  that  the </p><p>acceleration of the body towards the floor of the chest </p><p>is always of the same magnitude, whatever kind of </p><p>body he may happen to use for the experiment.  </p><p></p><p>Relying  on  his  knowledge  of  the  gravitational </p><p>field (as it was discussed in the preceding section), </p><p>the  man  in  the  chest  will  thus  come  to  the  con-</p><p>clusion that he and the chest are in a gravitational </p><p>field  which  is  constant  with  regard  to  time.  Of </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>80     GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>course he will be puzzled for a moment as to why </p><p>the  chest  does  not  fall  in  this  gravitational  field. </p><p>Just  then,  however,  he  discovers  the  hook  in  the </p><p>middle of the lid of the chest and the rope which </p><p>is  attached  to  it,  and  he  consequently  comes  to </p><p>the conclusion that the chest is suspended at rest </p><p>in the gravitational field.  </p><p></p><p>Ought  we  to  smile  at  the  man  and say  that  he </p><p>errs in his conclusion? I do not believe we ought </p><p>if  we  wish  to  remain  consistent;  we  must  rather </p><p>admit  that  his  mode  of  grasping  the  situation </p><p>violates  neither  reason  nor  known  mechanical </p><p>laws.  Even  though  it  is  being  accelerated  with </p><p>respect  to  the  “Galileian  space”  first  considered, </p><p>we  can  nevertheless  regard  the  chest  as  being  at </p><p>rest.  We  have  thus  good  grounds  for  extending </p><p>the  principle  of  relativity  to  include  bodies  of </p><p>reference  which  are  accelerated  with  respect  to </p><p>each  other,  and  as  a  result  we  have  gained  a </p><p>powerful  argument  for  a  generalised  postulate </p><p>of relativity.  </p><p></p><p>We  must  note  carefully  that  the  possibility  of </p><p>this mode of interpretation rests on the fundamen-</p><p>tal  property  of  the  gravitational  field  of  giving </p><p>all  bodies  the  same  acceleration,  or,  what  comes </p><p>to  the  same  thing,  on  the  law  of  the  equality  of </p><p>inertial  and  gravitational  mass.  If  this  natural </p><p>law did not exist, the man in the accelerated chest </p><p>would  not  be  able  to  interpret  the  behaviour  of </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>INERTIAL  AND  GRAVITATIONAL  MASS     81 </p><p></p><p>the  bodies  around  him  on  the  supposition  of  a </p><p>gravitational  field,  and  he  would  not  be  justified </p><p>on  the  grounds  of  experience  in  supposing  his </p><p>reference-body to be “at rest.”  </p><p></p><p>Suppose that the man in the chest fixes a rope </p><p>to  the  inner  side  of  the  lid,  and  that  he  attaches </p><p>a  body  to  the  free  end  of  the  rope.  The  result  of </p><p>this  will  be  to  stretch  the  rope  so  that  it  will </p><p>hang  “vertically”  downwards.  If  we  ask  for  an </p><p>opinion  of  the  cause  of  tension  in  the  rope,  the </p><p>man  in  the  chest  will  say:  “The  suspended  body </p><p>experiences a downward force in the gravitational </p><p>field, and this is neutralised by the tension of the </p><p>rope;  what  determines  the  magnitude  of  the  ten-</p><p>sion  of  the  rope  is  the  gravitational  mass  of  the </p><p>suspended  body.”  On  the  other  hand,  an  ob-</p><p>server who is poised freely in space will interpret </p><p>the  condition  of  things  thus:  “The  rope  must </p><p>perforce  take  part  in  the  accelerated  motion  of </p><p>the chest, and it transmits this motion to the body </p><p>attached  to  it.  The  tension  of  the  rope  is  just </p><p>large enough to effect the acceleration of the body. </p><p>That  which  determines  the  magnitude  of  the </p><p>tension  of  the  rope  is  the  inertial  mass  of  the </p><p>body.”  Guided  by  this  example,  we  see  that  our </p><p>extension  of  the  principle  of  relativity  implies </p><p>the necessity of the law of the equality of inertial </p><p>and  gravitational  mass.  Thus  we  have  obtained </p><p>a physical interpretation of this law. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>82     GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>From our consideration of the accelerated chest </p><p>we  see  that  a  general  theory  of  relativity  must </p><p>yield important results on the laws of gravitation. </p><p>In  point  of  fact,  the  systematic  pursuit  of  the </p><p>general  idea  of  relativity  has  supplied  the  laws </p><p>satisfied  by  the  gravitational  field.  Before  pro-</p><p>ceeding farther, however, I must warn the reader </p><p>against  a  misconception  suggested  by  these  con-</p><p>siderations.  A  gravitational  field  exists  for  the </p><p>man  in  the  chest,  despite  the  fact  that  there  was </p><p>no  such  field  for  the  co-ordinate  system  first </p><p>chosen.  Now  we  might  easily  suppose  that  the </p><p>existence  of  a  gravitational  field  is  always  only </p><p>an  apparent  one.  We  might  also  think  that, </p><p>regardless of the kind of gravitational field which </p><p>may be present, we could always choose another </p><p>reference-body  such  that  no  gravitational  field </p><p>exists  with  reference  to  it.  This  is  by  no  means </p><p>true for all gravitational fields, but only for those </p><p>of  quite  special  form.  It  is,  for  instance,  im-</p><p>possible to choose a body of reference such that, </p><p>as  judged  from  it,  the  gravitational  field  of  the </p><p>earth (in its entirety) vanishes.  </p><p></p><p>We  can  now  appreciate  why  that  argument  is </p><p>not convincing, which we brought forward against </p><p>the  general  principle  of  relativity  at  the  end  of </p><p>Section  XVIII.  It  is  certainly  true  that  the </p><p>observer  in  the  railway  carriage  experiences  a </p><p>jerk forwards as a result of the application of the </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>INERTIAL  AND  GRAVITATIONAL  MASS     83 </p><p></p><p>brake,  and  that  he  recognises  in  this  the  non- </p><p>uniformity of motion (retardation) of the carriage. </p><p>But he is  compelled by  nobody  to  refer  this  jerk </p><p>to  a  “real”  acceleration  (retardation)  of  the </p><p>carriage.  He  might  also  interpret  his  experience </p><p>thus:  “My  body  of  reference  (the  carriage) </p><p>remains  permanently  at  rest.  With  reference  to </p><p>it,  however,  there  exists  (during  the  period  of </p><p>application  of  the  brakes)  a  gravitational  field </p><p>which is directed forwards and which is variable </p><p>with  respect  to  time.  Under  the  influence  of  this </p><p>field,  the  embankment  together  with  the  earth </p><p>moves non-uniformly in such a manner that their </p><p>original  velocity  in  the  backwards  direction  is </p><p>continuously reduced.” </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>XXI </p><p></p><p>IN  WHAT  RESPECTS  ARE  THE  FOUNDATIONS </p><p>OF  CLASSICAL  MECHANICS  AND  OF  THE </p><p>SPECIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY  UN-</p><p>SATISFACTORY? </p><p></p><p>W </p><p></p><p>E  have  already  stated  several  times  that </p><p>  classical  mechanics  starts  out  from  the </p><p>  following  law:  Material  particles  suf-</p><p>ficiently far removed from other material particles </p><p>continue  to  move  uniformly  in  a  straight  line </p><p>or  continue  in  a  state  of  rest.  We  have  also </p><p>repeatedly  emphasised  that  this  fundamental  law </p><p>can only be valid for bodies of reference K which </p><p>possess certain unique states of motion, and which </p><p>are  in  uniform  translational  motion  relative  to </p><p>each  other.  Relative  to  other  reference-bodies </p><p>K the law is not valid. Both in classical mechanics </p><p>and  in  the  special  theory  of  relativity  we  there-</p><p>fore  differentiate  between  reference-bodies  K </p><p>relative to which the recognised “laws of nature” </p><p>can  be  said  to  hold,  and  reference-bodies  K </p><p>relative to which these laws do not hold.  </p><p></p><p>But no person whose mode of thought is logical </p><p>can  rest  satisfied  with  this  condition  of  things. </p><p>He  asks:  “How  does  it  come  that  certain  refer- </p><p>84 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>MECHANICS  AND  RELATIVITY           85 </p><p></p><p>ence-bodies  (or  their  states  of  motion)  are  given </p><p>priority  over  other  reference-bodies  (or  their </p><p>states  of  motion)?  What  is  the  reason  for  this </p><p>preference? In order to show clearly what I mean </p><p>by this question, I shall make use of a comparison.  </p><p>I  am  standing in front of  a gas  range. Stand-</p><p>ing alongside of each other on the range are two </p><p>pans so much alike that one may be mistaken for </p><p>the  other.  Both  are  half  full  of  water.  I  notice </p><p>that steam is being emitted continuously from the </p><p>one pan, but not from the other. I am surprised at </p><p>this, even if I have never seen either a gas range </p><p>or  a  pan  before.  But  if  I  now  notice  a  luminous </p><p>something of bluish colour under the first pan but </p><p>not under the other, I cease to be astonished, even </p><p>if  I  have  never  before  seen  a  gas  flame.  For  I </p><p>can only say that this bluish something will cause </p><p>the  emission  of  the  steam,  or  at  least  possibly  it </p><p>may  do  so.  If,  however,  I  notice  the  bluish </p><p>something  in  neither  case,  and  if  I  observe  that </p><p>the  one  continuously  emits  steam  whilst  the </p><p>other  does  not,  then  I  shall  remain  astonished </p><p>and  dissatisfied  until  I  have  discovered  some </p><p>circumstance to which I can attribute the different </p><p>behaviour of the two pans.  </p><p></p><p>Analogously, I seek in vain for a real something </p><p>in  classical  mechanics  (or  in  the  special  theory </p><p>of relativity) to which I can attribute the different </p><p>behaviour  of  bodies  considered  with  respect  to </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>86     GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>the  reference-systems  K  and  K'.1  Newton  saw </p><p>this  objection  and  attempted  to  invalidate  it,  but </p><p>without  success.  But  E.  Mach  recognised  it </p><p>most clearly of all, and because of this objection </p><p>he  claimed  that  mechanics  must  be  placed  on  a </p><p>new basis. It can only be got rid of by  means of </p><p>a  physics  which  is  conformable  to  the  general </p><p>principle of relativity, since the equations of such </p><p>a theory hold for every body of reference, whatever </p><p>may be its state of motion. </p><p></p><p>1 The  objection  is  of  importance  more  especially  when  the  state </p><p>of  motion  of  the  reference-body  is  of  such  a  nature  that  it  does  not </p><p>require any external agency for its maintenance, e.g. in the case when </p><p>the reference-body is rotating uniformly. </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>XXII </p><p></p><p>A  FEW  INFERENCES  FROM  THE  GENERAL </p><p>THEORY *  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>T </p><p></p><p>HE    considerations    of    Section  XX    show </p><p>  that the general theory* of relativity puts </p><p>  us in a position to derive properties of the </p><p>gravitational field in a purely theoretical manner. </p><p>Let  us  suppose,  for  instance,  that  we  know  the </p><p>space-time  “course”  for  any  natural  process </p><p>whatsoever,  as  regards  the  manner  in  which  it </p><p>takes  place  in  the  Galileian  domain  relative  to  a </p><p>Galileian  body  of  reference  K.  By  means  of </p><p>purely  theoretical  operations  (i.e.  simply  by  cal-</p><p>culation) we are then able to find how this known </p><p>natural process appears, as seen from a reference- </p><p>body  K'  which  is  accelerated  relatively  to  K. </p><p>But since a gravitational field exists with respect </p><p>to this new body of reference K', our consideration </p><p>also  teaches  us  how  the  gravitational  field  in-</p><p>fluences the process studied.  </p><p></p><p>For  example,  we  learn  that  a  body  which  is </p><p>in  a  state  of  uniform  rectilinear  motion  with </p><p>respect  to  K  (in  accordance  with  the  law  of </p><p>Galilei) is executing an accelerated and in general </p><p>87 </p><p></p><p>[* The word “theory” was changed to “principle” in both places in </p><p></p><p>later editions. — J.M.] </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>88     GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>curvilinear motion with respect to the accelerated </p><p>reference-body  K'  (chest).  This  acceleration  or </p><p>curvature  corresponds  to  the  influence  on  the </p><p>moving body of the gravitational field prevailing </p><p>relatively  to  K'.   It  is  known  that  a  gravita-</p><p>tional field influences the movement of bodies in </p><p>this  way,  so  that  our  consideration  supplies  us </p><p>with nothing essentially new.  </p><p></p><p>However, we obtain a new result of fundamental </p><p>importance  when  we  carry  out  the  analogous </p><p>consideration  for  a  ray  of  light.  With  respect </p><p>to  the  Galileian  reference-body  K,  such  a  ray  of </p><p>light is transmitted rectilinearly with the velocity </p><p>c.  It  can  easily  be  shown  that  the  path  of  the </p><p>same ray of light is no longer a straight line when </p><p>we  consider  it  with  reference  to  the  accelerated </p><p>chest  (reference-body  K').  From  this  we  con-</p><p>clude, that, in general, rays of light are propagated </p><p>curvilinearly  in  gravitational  fields.  In  two  re-</p><p>spects this result is of great importance.  </p><p></p><p>In  the  first place,  it  can be  compared  with  the </p><p>reality.  Although  a  detailed  examination  of  the </p><p>question  shows  that  the  curvature  of  light  rays </p><p>required  by  the  general  theory  of  relativity  is </p><p>only exceedingly small for the gravitational fields </p><p>at  our  disposal  in  practice,  its  estimated  magni-</p><p>tude  for  light  rays  passing  the  sun  at  grazing </p><p>incidence is nevertheless 1.7 seconds of arc. This </p><p>ought  to  manifest  itself  in  the  following  way. </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>INFERENCES  FROM  RELATIVITY         89 </p><p></p><p>As seen from the earth, certain fixed stars appear </p><p>to  be  in  the  neighbourhood  of  the  sun,  and  are </p><p>thus capable of observation during a total eclipse </p><p>of  the  sun.  At  such  times,  these  stars  ought  to </p><p>appear  to  be  displaced  outwards  from  the  sun </p><p>by an amount indicated above, as compared with </p><p>their  apparent  position  in  the  sky  when  the  sun </p><p>is  situated  at  another  part  of  the  heavens.  The </p><p>examination  of  the  correctness  or  otherwise  of </p><p>this  deduction  is  a  problem  of  the  greatest  im-</p><p>portance,  the  early  solution  of  which  is  to  be </p><p>expected of astronomers.1  </p><p></p><p>In  the  second  place  our  result  shows  that,  ac-</p><p>cording  to  the  general  theory  of  relativity,  the </p><p>law  of  the  constancy  of  the  velocity  of  light  in </p><p>vacuo,  which  constitutes  one  of  the  two  funda-</p><p>mental  assumptions  in  the  special  theory  of </p><p>relativity and to which we have already frequently </p><p>referred,  cannot  claim  any  unlimited  validity. </p><p>A  curvature  of  rays  of  light  can  only  take  place </p><p>when  the  velocity  of  propagation  of  light  varies </p><p>with  position.  Now  we  might  think  that  as  a </p><p>consequence of this, the special theory of relativity </p><p>and  with  it  the  whole  theory  of  relativity  would </p><p>be  laid  in  the  dust.

We  can  only  conclude  that  the  special </p><p>theory  of  relativity  cannot  claim  an  unlimited </p><p>domain  of  validity;  its  results  hold  only  so  long </p><p>as  we  are  able  to  disregard  the  influences  of </p><p>gravitational  fields  on  the  phenomena  (e.g.  of </p><p>light).  </p><p></p><p>Since  it  has  often  been  contended  by  oppo-</p><p>nents  of  the  theory  of  relativity  that  the  special </p><p>theory  of  relativity  is  overthrown  by  the  general </p><p>theory of relativity, it is perhaps advisable to make </p><p>the  facts  of  the  case  clearer  by  means  of  an </p><p>appropriate  comparison.  Before  the  development </p><p>of  electrodynamics  the  laws  of  electrostatics  and </p><p>the  laws  of  electricity  were  regarded  indiscrim-</p><p>inately.  At  the  present  time  we  know  that </p><p>electric  fields  can  be derived  correctly  from  elec-</p><p>trostatic  considerations  only  for  the  case,  which </p><p>is  never  strictly  realised,  in  which  the  electrical </p><p>masses  are  quite  at  rest  relatively  to  each  other, </p><p>and  to  the  co-ordinate  system.  Should  we  be </p><p>justified  in  saying  that  for  this  reason  electro-</p><p>statics  is  overthrown  by  the  field-equations  of </p><p>Maxwell  in  electrodynamics?  Not  in  the  least. </p><p>Electrostatics  is  contained  in  electrodynamics </p><p>as  a  limiting  case;  the  laws  of  the  latter  lead </p><p>directly to those of the former for the case in which </p><p>the  fields  are  invariable  with  regard  to  time. </p><p>No fairer destiny could be allotted to any physical </p><p>theory,  than  that  it  should  of  itself  point  out  the </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>INFERENCES  FROM  RELATIVITY         91 </p><p></p><p>way to the introduction of a more comprehensive </p><p>theory, in which it lives on as a limiting case.  </p><p></p><p>In the example of the transmission of light just </p><p>dealt  with,  we  have  seen  that  the  general  theory </p><p>of  relativity  enables  us  to  derive  theoretically </p><p>the influence of a gravitational field on the course </p><p>of natural processes, the laws of which are already </p><p>known  when  a  gravitational  field  is  absent.  But </p><p>the  most  attractive  problem,  to  the  solution  of </p><p>which  the  general  theory  of  relativity  supplies </p><p>the  key,  concerns  the  investigation  of  the  laws </p><p>satisfied  by  the  gravitational  field  itself.  Let  us </p><p>consider this for a moment.  </p><p></p><p>We  are  acquainted  with  space-time  domains </p><p>which  behave  (approximately)  in  a  “Galileian” </p><p>fashion  under  suitable  choice  of  reference-body, </p><p>i.e.  domains  in  which  gravitational  fields  are </p><p>absent.  If  we  now  refer  such  a  domain  to  a </p><p>reference-body K' possessing any kind of motion, </p><p>then  relative  to  K'  there  exists  a  gravitational </p><p>field  which  is variable  with  respect  to  space  and </p><p>time.1  The  character  of  this  field  will  of  course </p><p>depend  on  the  motion  chosen  for  K'.    Accord-</p><p>ing to the general theory of relativity, the general </p><p>law  of  the  gravitational  field  must  be  satisfied </p><p>for all gravitational fields obtainable in this way. </p><p>Even though by no means all gravitational fields </p><p></p><p>1 This  follows  from  a  generalisation  of  the  discussion  in  Sec-</p><p></p><p>tion XX. </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>92     GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>can  be produced in  this  way,  yet  we  may  enter-</p><p>tain  the  hope  that  the  general  law  of  gravitation </p><p>will be derivable from such gravitational fields of </p><p>a  special  kind.  This  hope  has  been  realised  in </p><p>the  most  beautiful  manner.  But  between  the </p><p>clear vision of this goal and its actual realisation </p><p>it was necessary to surmount a serious difficulty, </p><p>and  as  this  lies  deep  at  the  root  of  things,  I  dare </p><p>not  withhold  it  from  the  reader.  We  require </p><p>to  extend  our  ideas  of  the  space-time  continuum </p><p>still farther. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>XXIII </p><p></p><p>BEHAVIOUR  OF  CLOCKS  AND  MEASURING–</p><p>RODS  ON  A  ROTATING  BODY </p><p>OF  REFERENCE </p><p></p><p>H </p><p></p><p>ITHERTO  I  have  purposely  refrained </p><p>  from  speaking  about  the  physical  in-</p><p>  terpretation  of  space-  and  time-data  in </p><p>the  case  of  the  general  theory  of  relativity.  As  a </p><p>consequence, I am guilty of a certain slovenliness </p><p>of treatment, which, as we know from the special </p><p>theory  of  relativity,  is  far  from  being  unim-</p><p>portant  and  pardonable.  It  is  now  high  time </p><p>that  we  remedy  this defect;  but  I  would  mention </p><p>at the outset, that this matter lays no small claims </p><p>on  the  patience  and  on  the  power  of  abstraction </p><p>of the reader.  </p><p></p><p>We  start  off  again  from  quite  special  cases, </p><p>which  we  have  frequently  used  before.  Let  us </p><p>consider a space-time domain in which no gravi-</p><p>tational  field  exists  relative  to  a  reference-body </p><p>K whose state of motion has been suitably chosen. </p><p>K  is  then  a  Galileian  reference-body  as  regards </p><p>the  domain  considered,  and  the  results  of  the </p><p>special  theory  of  relativity  hold  relative  to  K. </p><p>Let  us  suppose  the  same  domain  referred  to  a </p><p>93 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>94     GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>second  body  of  reference  K',  which  is  rotating </p><p>uniformly  with  respect  to  K.  In  order  to  fix  our </p><p>ideas, we shall imagine K' to be in the form of a </p><p>plane  circular  disc,  which  rotates  uniformly  in </p><p>its  own  plane  about  its  centre.  An  observer </p><p>who  is  sitting  eccentrically  on  the  disc  K'  is </p><p>sensible of a force which acts outwards in a radial </p><p>direction,  and  which  would  be  interpreted  as  an </p><p>effect of inertia (centrifugal force) by an observer </p><p>who  was  at  rest  with  respect  to  the  original </p><p>reference-body  K.  But  the  observer  on  the  disc </p><p>may  regard  his  disc  as  a  reference-body  which </p><p>is  “at  rest”;  on  the  basis  of  the  general  principle </p><p>of  relativity  he  is  justified  in  doing  this.  The </p><p>force  acting  on  himself,  and  in  fact  on  all  other </p><p>bodies  which  are  at  rest  relative  to  the  disc,  he </p><p>regards  as  the  effect  of  a  gravitational  field. </p><p>Nevertheless, the space-distribution of this gravi-</p><p>tational field is of a kind that would not be possible </p><p>on  Newton’s  theory  of  gravitation.1  But  since </p><p>the  observer  believes  in  the  general  theory  of </p><p>relativity,  this  does  not  disturb  him;  he  is  quite </p><p>in  the  right  when  he  believes  that  a  general  law </p><p>of  gravitation  can  be  formulated — a  law  which </p><p>not  only  explains  the  motion  of  the  stars  cor-</p><p>rectly,  but  also  the  field  of  force  experienced  by </p><p>himself. </p><p></p><p>1 The field disappears at the centre of the disc and increases pro-</p><p>portionally  to  the  distance  from  the  centre  as  we  proceed  outwards. </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>BEHAVIOUR  OF  CLOCKS  AND  RODS     95 </p><p></p><p>The observer performs experiments on his cir-</p><p>cular  disc  with  clocks  and  measuring-rods.  In </p><p>doing  so,  it  is  his  intention  to  arrive  at  exact </p><p>definitions  for  the  signification  of  time-  and </p><p>space-data  with  reference  to  the  circular  disc  K', </p><p>these definitions being based on his observations. </p><p>What will be his experience in this enterprise?  </p><p></p><p>To start with, he places one of two identically </p><p>constructed  clocks  at  the  centre  of  the  circular </p><p>disc, and the other on the edge of the disc, so that </p><p>they  are  at  rest  relative  to  it.  We  now  ask  our-</p><p>selves  whether  both  clocks  go  at  the  same  rate </p><p>from the standpoint of the non-rotating Galileian </p><p>reference-body  K.  As  judged  from  this  body, </p><p>the clock at the centre of the disc has no velocity, </p><p>whereas  the  clock  at  the  edge  of  the  disc  is  in </p><p>motion  relative  to  K  in  consequence  of  the  rota-</p><p>tion.  According  to  a  result  obtained  in  Section </p><p>XII, it follows that the latter clock goes at a rate </p><p>permanently  slower  than  that  of  the  clock  at </p><p>the  centre  of  the  circular  disc,  i.e.  as  observed </p><p>from  K.  It  is  obvious  that  the  same  effect  would </p><p>be  noted  by  an  observer  whom  we  will  imagine </p><p>sitting  alongside  his  clock  at  the  centre  of  the </p><p>circular  disc.  Thus  on  our  circular  disc,  or,  to </p><p>make the case more general, in every gravitational </p><p>field, a clock will go more quickly or less quickly, </p><p>according  to  the  position  in  which  the  clock  is </p><p>situated  (at  rest).  For  this  reason  it  is  not </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>96     GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>possible to obtain a reasonable definition of time </p><p>with  the  aid  of  clocks  which  are  arranged  at </p><p>rest  with  respect  to  the  body  of  reference.  A </p><p>similar difficulty presents itself when we attempt </p><p>to  apply  our  earlier  definition  of  simultaneity  in </p><p>such  a  case,  but  I  do  not  wish  to  go  any  farther </p><p>into this question.  </p><p></p><p>Moreover,  at  this  stage  the  definition  of  the </p><p>space  co-ordinates  also  presents  unsurmountable </p><p>difficulties.  If  the  observer  applies  his  standard </p><p>measuring-rod (a rod which is short as compared </p><p>with  the  radius  of  the  disc)  tangentially  to  the </p><p>edge of the disc, then, as judged from the Galileian </p><p>system, the length of this rod will be less than 1, </p><p>since,  according  to  Section  XII,  moving  bodies </p><p>suffer a shortening in the direction of the motion. </p><p>On  the  other  hand,  the  measuring-rod  will  not </p><p>experience a shortening in length, as judged from </p><p>K,  if  it  is  applied  to  the  disc  in  the  direction  of </p><p>the  radius.  If,  then,  the  observer  first  measures </p><p>the circumference of the disc with his measuring- </p><p>rod  and  then  the  diameter  of  the  disc,  on  divid-</p><p>ing  the  one  by  the  other,  he  will  not  obtain  as </p><p>quotient  the  familiar  number  p  = 3.14  .  .  .,  but </p><p>a  larger  number,1  whereas  of  course,  for  a  disc </p><p>which  is  at  rest  with  respect  to  K,  this  operation </p><p>1 Throughout  this  consideration  we  have  to  use  the  Galileian </p><p>(non-rotating) system K as reference-body, since we may only assume </p><p>the  validity  of  the  results  of  the  special  theory  of  relativity  relative </p><p>to K (relative to K' a gravitational field prevails). </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>BEHAVIOUR  OF  CLOCKS  AND  RODS     97 </p><p></p><p>would  yield  p   exactly.  This  proves  that  the </p><p>propositions  of  Euclidean  geometry  cannot  hold </p><p>exactly  on  the  rotating  disc,  nor  in  general  in  a </p><p>gravitational  field,  at  least  if  we  attribute  the </p><p>length  1  to  the  rod  in  all  positions  and  in  every </p><p>orientation.  Hence  the  idea  of  a  straight  line </p><p>also  loses  its  meaning.  We  are  therefore  not  in </p><p>a  position  to  define  exactly  the  co-ordinates </p><p>x, y, z relative to the disc by means of the method </p><p>used in discussing the special theory, and as long </p><p>as  the  co-ordinates  and  times  of  events  have  not </p><p>been defined we cannot assign an exact meaning </p><p>to the natural laws in which these occur.  </p><p></p><p>Thus  all  our  previous  conclusions  based  on </p><p>general  relativity  would  appear  to  be  called  in </p><p>question.  In  reality  we  must  make  a  subtle </p><p>detour  in  order  to  be  able  to  apply  the  postulate </p><p>of  general  relativity  exactly.  I  shall  prepare </p><p>the reader for this in the following paragraphs.  </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>XXIV </p><p></p><p>EUCLIDEAN  AND  NON–EUCLIDEAN </p><p>CONTINUUM </p><p></p><p>T </p><p></p><p>HE  surface  of  a  marble  table  is  spread  out </p><p>  in  front  of  me.  I  can  get  from  any  one </p><p>  point  on  this  table  to  any  other  point  by </p><p>passing continuously from one point to a “neigh-</p><p>bouring” one, and repeating this process a (large) </p><p>number  of  times,  or,  in  other  words,  by  going </p><p>from  point  to  point  without  executing  “jumps.” *  </p><p>I am sure the reader will appreciate with sufficient </p><p>clearness  what  I  mean  here  by  “neighbouring” </p><p>and  by  “jumps”  (if  he  is  not  too  pedantic).  We </p><p>express this property of the surface by describing </p><p>the latter as a continuum.  </p><p></p><p>Let  us  now  imagine  that  a  large  number  of </p><p>little  rods  of  equal  length  have  been  made,  their </p><p>lengths being small compared with the dimensions </p><p>of the marble slab. When I say they are of equal </p><p>length,  I  mean  that  one  can  be laid on  any  other </p><p>without  the  ends  overlapping.  We  next  lay  four </p><p>of these little rods on the marble slab so that they </p><p>constitute  a  quadrilateral  figure  (a  square),  the </p><p>diagonals  of  which  are  equally  long.  To  ensure </p><p>the  equality  of  the  diagonals,  we  make  use  of  a </p><p>98 </p><p></p><p>[* jumps.” — J.M.] </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>EUCLIDEAN  AND  NON-EUCLIDEAN       99 </p><p></p><p>little  testing-rod.  To  this  square  we  add  similar </p><p>ones, each of which has one rod in common with </p><p>the first. We proceed in like manner with each of </p><p>these  squares  until  finally  the  whole  marble  slab </p><p>is  laid  out  with  squares.  The  arrangement  is </p><p>such,  that  each  side  of  a  square  belongs  to  two </p><p>squares and each corner to four squares.  </p><p></p><p>It  is  a  veritable  wonder  that  we  can  carry  out </p><p>this  business  without  getting  into  the  greatest </p><p>difficulties.  We  only  need  to  think  of  the  fol-</p><p>lowing.  If  at  any  moment  three  squares  meet </p><p>at  a  corner,  then  two  sides  of  the  fourth  square </p><p>are  already  laid,  and  as  a  consequence,  the  ar-</p><p>rangement  of  the  remaining  two  sides  of  the </p><p>square  is  already  completely  determined.  But </p><p>I am now no longer able to adjust the quadrilateral </p><p>so  that  its  diagonals  may  be  equal.  If  they  are </p><p>equal of their own accord, then this is an especial </p><p>favour  of  the  marble  slab  and  of  the  little  rods </p><p>about  which  I  can  only  be  thankfully  surprised. </p><p>We  must  needs  experience  many  such  surprises </p><p>if the construction is to be successful.  </p><p></p><p>If  everything  has  really  gone  smoothly,  then </p><p>I say that the points of the marble slab constitute a </p><p>Euclidean  continuum  with  respect  to  the  little </p><p>rod,  which  has  been  used  as  a  “distance”  (line- </p><p>interval).  By  choosing  one  corner  of  a  square  as </p><p>“origin,”  I  can  characterise  every  other  corner </p><p>of a square with reference to this origin by means </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>100    GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>of  two  numbers.  I  only  need  state  how  many </p><p>rods  I  must  pass  over  when,  starting  from  the </p><p>origin,  I  proceed  towards  the  “right”  and  then </p><p>“upwards,” in order to arrive at the corner of the </p><p>square  under  consideration.  These  two  numbers </p><p>are  then  the  “Cartesian  co-ordinates”  of  this </p><p>corner  with  reference  to  the  “Cartesian  co- </p><p>ordinate  system”  which  is  determined  by  the </p><p>arrangement of little rods.  </p><p></p><p>By  making  use  of  the  following  modification </p><p>of  this  abstract  experiment,  we  recognise  that </p><p>there must also be cases in which the experiment </p><p>would  be  unsuccessful.  We  shall  suppose  that </p><p>the  rods  “expand”  by  an  amount  proportional  to </p><p>the  increase  of  temperature.  We  heat  the  central </p><p>part  of  the  marble  slab,  but  not  the  periphery, </p><p>in  which  case  two  of  our  little  rods  can  still  be </p><p>brought  into  coincidence  at  every  position  on </p><p>the  table.  But  our  construction  of  squares  must </p><p>necessarily come into disorder during the heating, </p><p>because  the  little  rods  on  the  central  region  of </p><p>the  table  expand,  whereas  those  on  the  outer </p><p>part do not.  </p><p></p><p>With  reference  to  our  little  rods — defined  as </p><p>unit  lengths — the  marble  slab  is  no  longer  a </p><p>Euclidean  continuum,  and  we  are  also  no  longer </p><p>in the position of defining Cartesian co-ordinates </p><p>directly  with  their  aid,  since  the  above  construc-</p><p>tion  can  no  longer  be  carried  out.  But  since </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>EUCLIDEAN  AND  NON-EUCLIDEAN     101 </p><p></p><p>there  are  other  things  which  are  not  influenced </p><p>in  a  similar  manner  to  the  little  rods  (or  perhaps </p><p>not  at  all)  by  the  temperature  of  the  table,  it  is </p><p>possible  quite  naturally  to  maintain  the  point  of </p><p>view  that  the  marble  slab  is  a  “Euclidean  con-</p><p>tinuum.”  This  can  be  done  in  a  satisfactory </p><p>manner  by  making  a  more  subtle  stipulation </p><p>about  the  measurement  or  the  comparison  of </p><p>lengths.  </p><p></p><p>But if rods of every kind (i.e. of every material) </p><p>were  to  behave  in  the  same  way  as  regards  the </p><p>influence  of  temperature  when  they  are  on  the </p><p>variably  heated  marble  slab,  and  if  we  had  no </p><p>other means of detecting the effect of temperature </p><p>than  the  geometrical  behaviour  of  our  rods  in </p><p>experiments analogous to the one described above, </p><p>then our best plan would be to assign the distance </p><p>one  to  two  points  on  the  slab,  provided  that  the </p><p>ends of one of our rods could be made to coincide </p><p>with  these  two  points;  for  how  else  should  we </p><p>define the distance without our proceeding being </p><p>in  the  highest  measure  grossly  arbitrary?  The </p><p>method  of  Cartesian  co-ordinates  must  then  be </p><p>discarded,  and  replaced  by  another  which  does </p><p>not  assume  the  validity  of  Euclidean  geometry </p><p>for  rigid  bodies.1  The  reader  will  notice  that </p><p>1 Mathematicians  have  been  confronted  with  our  problem  in  the </p><p>following form. If we are given a surface (e.g. an ellipsoid) in Eucli-</p><p>dean  three-dimensional  space,  then  there  exists  for  this  surface  a </p><p>two-dimensional  geometry,  just  as  much  as  for  a  plane  surface. </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>102    GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>the situation depicted here corresponds to the one </p><p>brought about by the general postulate of relativity </p><p>(Section XXIII).  </p><p></p><p>Gauss  undertook  the  task  of  treating  this  two-dimensional  geometry </p><p>from first principles,  without  making use of the  fact that the surface </p><p>belongs  to  a  Euclidean  continuum  of  three  dimensions.  If  we  im-</p><p>agine constructions to be made with rigid rods in the surface (similar </p><p>to  that  above  with  the  marble  slab),  we  should  find  that  different </p><p>laws  hold  for  these  from  those  resulting  on  the  basis  of  Euclidean </p><p>plane  geometry.  The  surface  is  not  a  Euclidean  continuum  with </p><p>respect  to  the  rods,  and  we  cannot  define  Cartesian  co-ordinates  in </p><p>the  surface.  Gauss  indicated  the  principles  according  to  which  we </p><p>can  treat  the  geometrical  relationships  in  the  surface,  and  thus </p><p>pointed  out  the  way  to  the  method  of  Riemann  of  treating  multi- </p><p>dimensional,  non-Euclidean  continua.  Thus  it  is  that  mathemati-</p><p>cians long ago solved the formal problems to which we are led by the </p><p>general postulate of relativity. </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>XXV </p><p></p><p>GAUSSIAN  CO–ORDINATES </p><p></p><p>A </p><p></p><p>CCORDING to Gauss, this combined ana-</p><p>  lytical and geometrical mode of handling </p><p>  the  problem  can  be  arrived  at  in  the </p><p>following way. We imagine a system of arbitrary </p><p>curves  (see  Fig.  4)  drawn  on  the  surface  of  the </p><p>table.  These  we  designate  as  u-curves,  and  we </p><p>indicate  each  of  them  by  means  of  a  number. </p><p>The  curves  u = 1,  u = 2  and  u = 3  are  drawn </p><p>in  the  diagram.  Between  the  curves  u = 1  and </p><p>u = 2 we must imagine an </p><p>infinitely large number to </p><p>be  drawn,  all  of  which </p><p>correspond  to  real  num-</p><p>bers lying between  1 and </p><p>2. We have then a system </p><p>of u-curves, and this “in-</p><p>finitely dense” system covers the whole surface of </p><p>the table. These u-curves must not intersect each </p><p>other,  and  through  each  point  of  the  surface  one </p><p>and  only  one  curve  must  pass.  Thus  a  perfectly </p><p>definite value of u belongs to every point on the </p><p>surface  of  the  marble  slab.  In  like  manner  we </p><p>103 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>104    GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>imagine a system of v-curves drawn on the surface. </p><p>These satisfy the same conditions as the u-curves, </p><p>they are provided with numbers in a correspond-</p><p>ing manner, and they may likewise be of arbitrary </p><p>shape.  It  follows  that  a  value  of  u  and  a  value </p><p>of  v  belong  to  every  point  on  the  surface  of  the </p><p>table.  We  call  these  two  numbers  the  co-or-</p><p>dinates  of  the  surface  of  the  table  (Gaussian </p><p>co-ordinates).  For  example,  the  point  P  in  the </p><p>diagram  has  the  Gaussian  co-ordinates  u = 3, </p><p>v = 1.  Two  neighbouring  points  P  and  P'  on </p><p>the  surface  then  correspond  to  the  co-ordinates </p><p>u, v </p><p>u + du, v + dv, </p><p></p><p>P: </p><p>P': </p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>11</p><p></p><p>12</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>g</p><p></p><p>g</p><p></p><p>=</p><p></p><p>+</p><p></p><p>+</p><p></p><p>ds</p><p></p><p>dv</p><p></p><p>du</p><p></p><p>du</p><p></p><p>where  du  and  dv  signify  very  small  numbers.  In </p><p>a  similar  manner  we  may  indicate  the  distance </p><p>(line-interval)  between  P  and  P',  as  measured </p><p>with  a  little  rod,  by  means  of  the  very  small </p><p>number  ds.  Then  according  to  Gauss  we  have </p><p>g</p><p>where  g11,  g12,  g22,  are  magnitudes  which  depend </p><p>in  a  perfectly  definite  way  on  u  and  v.  The </p><p>magnitudes g11, g12 and g22 determine the behaviour </p><p>of the rods relative to the u-curves and v-curves, </p><p>and  thus  also  relative  to  the  surface  of  the  table. </p><p>For  the  case  in  which  the  points  of  the  surface </p><p>considered  form  a  Euclidean  continuum  with </p><p>reference  to  the  measuring-rods,  but  only  in  this </p><p>case,  it  is  possible  to  draw  the  u-curves  and </p><p></p><p>dv</p><p></p><p>,2</p><p></p><p>22</p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>GAUSSIAN  CO–ORDINATES             105 </p><p></p><p>v-curves  and  to  attach  numbers  to  them,  in  such </p><p>a manner, that we simply have: </p><p>.2</p><p>dv</p><p></p><p>du</p><p></p><p>ds</p><p></p><p>=</p><p></p><p>+</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>Under these conditions, the u-curves and v-curves </p><p>are straight lines in the sense of Euclidean geom-</p><p>etry,  and  they  are  perpendicular  to  each  other. </p><p>Here  the  Gaussian  co-ordinates  are  simply  Car-</p><p>tesian  ones.  It  is  clear  that  Gauss  co-ordinates </p><p>are nothing  more  than  an association of two  sets </p><p>of  numbers  with  the  points  of  the  surface  con-</p><p>sidered,  of  such  a  nature  that  numerical  values </p><p>differing  very  slightly  from  each  other  are  asso-</p><p>ciated with neighbouring points “in space.”  </p><p></p><p>So  far,  these  considerations  hold  for  a  con-</p><p>tinuum  of  two  dimensions.  But  the  Gaussian </p><p>method  can  be  applied  also  to  a  continuum  of </p><p>three,  four  or  more  dimensions.  If,  for  instance, </p><p>a  continuum  of  four  dimensions  be  supposed </p><p>available,  we  may  represent  it  in  the  following </p><p>way.  With  every  point  of  the  continuum  we </p><p>associate  arbitrarily  four  numbers,  x1,  x2,  x3,  x4, </p><p>which  are  known  as  “co-ordinates.”  Adjacent </p><p>points  correspond  to  adjacent  values  of  the  co- </p><p>ordinates.  If  a  distance  ds  is  associated  with </p><p>the  adjacent  points  P  and  P',  this  distance  being </p><p>measurable and well-defined from a physical point </p><p>of view, then the following formula holds:  </p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>ds</p><p></p><p>=</p><p></p><p>g</p><p>11</p><p></p><p>2 </p><p>dx</p><p>1</p><p></p><p>+</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>g</p><p>12</p><p></p><p>dx</p><p>1</p><p></p><p>dx</p><p>2</p><p></p><p>.</p><p></p><p>.</p><p></p><p>.</p><p></p><p>.</p><p></p><p>+</p><p></p><p>g</p><p></p><p>44</p><p></p><p>2 </p><p>dx</p><p>4</p><p></p><p>, </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>106    GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>where the magnitudes g11, etc., have values which </p><p>vary  with  the  position  in  the  continuum.  Only </p><p>when  the  continuum  is  a  Euclidean  one  is  it </p><p>possible to associate the co-ordinates x1 . . x4 with </p><p>the  points  of  the  continuum  so  that  we  have </p><p>simply </p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>ds</p><p></p><p>=</p><p></p><p>2 </p><p>dx</p><p>1</p><p></p><p>+</p><p></p><p>dx</p><p></p><p>2 </p><p>2</p><p></p><p>+</p><p></p><p>2 </p><p>dx</p><p>3</p><p></p><p>+</p><p></p><p>dx</p><p></p><p>2 </p><p>4</p><p></p><p>. </p><p></p><p>In this case relations hold in the four-dimensional </p><p>continuum  which  are  analogous  to  those holding </p><p>in our three-dimensional measurements.  </p><p>However,  the  Gauss  treatment  for </p><p></p><p>2ds   which </p><p>we  have  given  above  is  not  always  possible.  It </p><p>is  only  possible  when  sufficiently  small  regions </p><p>of  the  continuum  under  consideration  may  be </p><p>regarded  as  Euclidean  continua.  For  example, </p><p>this obviously holds in the case of the marble slab </p><p>of  the  table  and  local  variation  of  temperature. </p><p>The  temperature  is  practically  constant  for  a </p><p>small  part  of  the  slab,  and  thus  the  geometrical </p><p>behaviour  of  the  rods  is  almost  as  it  ought  to  be </p><p>according  to  the  rules  of  Euclidean  geometry. </p><p>Hence  the  imperfections  of  the  construction  of </p><p>squares in the previous section do not show them-</p><p>selves  clearly  until  this  construction  is  extended </p><p>over  a  considerable  portion  of  the  surface  of  the </p><p>table.  </p><p></p><p>We can sum this up as follows: Gauss invented </p><p>a  method  for  the  mathematical  treatment  of </p><p>continua  in  general,  in  which  “size-relations” </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>GAUSSIAN  CO–ORDINATES             107 </p><p></p><p>(“distances”  between  neighbouring  points)  are </p><p>defined.  To  every  point  of  a  continuum  are </p><p>assigned  as  many  numbers  (Gaussian  co-ordi-</p><p>nates)  as  the  continuum  has  dimensions.  This </p><p>is done in such a way, that only one meaning can </p><p>be  attached  to  the  assignment,  and  that  numbers </p><p>(Gaussian  co-ordinates)  which  differ  by  an  in-</p><p>definitely  small  amount  are  assigned  to  adjacent </p><p>points.  The  Gaussian  co-ordinate  system  is  a </p><p>logical generalisation of the Cartesian co-ordinate </p><p>system.  It  is  also  applicable  to  non-Euclidean </p><p>continua,  but  only  when,  with  respect  to  the </p><p>defined  “size”  or  “distance,”  small  parts  of </p><p>the  continuum  under  consideration  behave  more </p><p>nearly  like  a  Euclidean  system,  the  smaller  the </p><p>part of the continuum under our notice.  </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>XXVI </p><p></p><p>THE  SPACE–TIME  CONTINUUM  OF  THE  SPE-</p><p>CIAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY  CONSID-</p><p>ERED  AS  A  EUCLIDEAN  CONTINUUM </p><p></p><p>W </p><p></p><p>E  are  now  in  a  position  to  formulate </p><p>  more  exactly  the  idea  of  Minkowski, </p><p>  which  was  only  vaguely  indicated  in </p><p>Section  XVII.

This  was  possible  on </p><p>the  basis  of  the  law  of  the  constancy  of  the  ve-</p><p>locity  of  light.  But  according  to  Section  XXII,* </p><p>the  general  theory  of  relativity  cannot  retain </p><p>this  law.  On  the  contrary,  we  arrived  at  the </p><p>result  that  according  to  this  latter  theory  the </p><p>velocity  of  light  must  always  depend  on  the  co- </p><p>ordinates  when  a  gravitational  field  is  pres-</p><p>ent.

Just  as  it  was  there </p><p>impossible  to  construct  a  Cartesian  co-ordinate </p><p>system  from  equal  rods,  so  here  it  is  impossible </p><p>to build  up  a system  (reference-body)  from  rigid </p><p>bodies and clocks, which shall be of such a nature </p><p>that  measuring-rods  and  clocks,  arranged  rigidly </p><p>with  respect  to  one  another,  shall  indicate  posi-</p><p>tion  and  time  directly.  Such  was  the  essence  of </p><p>the  difficulty  with  which  we  were  confronted  in </p><p>Section XXIII.  </p><p></p><p>But  the  considerations  of  Sections  XXV  and </p><p>XXVI  show  us  the  way  to  surmount  this  diffi-</p><p>culty.  We  refer  the  four-dimensional  space-time </p><p>continuum  in  an  arbitrary  manner  to  Gauss </p><p>co-ordinates.  We  assign  to  every  point  of  the </p><p>continuum  (event)  four  numbers,  x1,  x2,  x3,  x4 </p><p>(co-ordinates),  which  have  not  the  least  direct </p><p>physical  significance,  but  only  serve  the  purpose </p><p>of  numbering  the  points  of  the  continuum  in  a </p><p>definite  but  arbitrary  manner.  This  arrangement </p><p>does  not  even  need  to  be of  such  a  kind  that  we </p><p>must  regard  x1,  x2,  x3,  as  “space”  co-ordinates </p><p>and x4 as a “time” co-ordinate. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>SPACE–TIME  CONTINUUM              113 </p><p></p><p>The  reader  may  think  that  such  a  description </p><p>of  the  world  would  be  quite  inadequate.  What </p><p>does  it  mean  to  assign  to  an  event  the  particular </p><p>co-ordinates  x1,  x2,  x3,  x4,  if  in  themselves  these </p><p>co-ordinates  have  no  significance?  More  careful </p><p>consideration  shows,  however,  that  this  anxiety </p><p>is  unfounded.  Let  us  consider,  for  instance,  a </p><p>material  point  with  any  kind  of  motion.  If  this </p><p>point  had  only  a  momentary  existence  without </p><p>duration,  then  it  would  be  described  in  space- </p><p>time  by  a  single  system  of  values  x1,  x2,  x3,  x4. </p><p>Thus  its  permanent  existence  must  be  char-</p><p>acterised  by  an  infinitely  large  number  of  such </p><p>systems  of  values,  the  co-ordinate  values  of </p><p>which are so close together as to give continuity; </p><p>corresponding to the material point, we thus have </p><p>a  (uni-dimensional)  line  in  the  four-dimensional </p><p>continuum.  In  the  same  way,  any  such  lines </p><p>in  our  continuum  correspond  to  many  points  in </p><p>motion.  The  only  statements  having  regard  to </p><p>these points which can claim a physical existence </p><p>are  in  reality  the  statements  about  their  en-</p><p>counters.  In  our  mathematical  treatment,  such </p><p>an  encounter  is  expressed  in  the  fact  that  the </p><p>two  lines  which  represent  the  motions  of  the </p><p>points  in  question  have  a  particular  system  of </p><p>co-ordinate  values,  x1,  x2,  x3,  x4,  in  common. </p><p>After mature consideration the reader will doubt-</p><p>less  admit  that  in  reality  such  encounters  con- </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>114    GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>stitute  the  only  actual  evidence  of  a  time-space </p><p>nature with which we meet in physical statements. </p><p>When  we  were  describing  the  motion  of  a </p><p>material point relative to a body of reference, we </p><p>stated  nothing  more  than  the  encounters  of  this </p><p>point with particular points of the reference-body. </p><p>We  can  also  determine  the  corresponding  values </p><p>of  the  time  by  the  observation  of  encounters  of </p><p>the  body  with  clocks,  in  conjunction  with  the </p><p>observation  of  the  encounter  of  the  hands  of </p><p>clocks  with  particular  points  on  the  dials.  It  is </p><p>just  the  same  in  the  case  of  space-measurements </p><p>by means of measuring-rods, as a little considera-</p><p>tion will show.  </p><p></p><p>The following statements hold generally: Every </p><p>physical description resolves itself into a number </p><p>of  statements,  each of  which  refers to  the  space- </p><p>time  coincidence  of  two  events  A  and  B.  In </p><p>terms of Gaussian co-ordinates, every such state-</p><p>ment is expressed by the agreement of their four </p><p>co-ordinates  x1,  x2,  x3,  x4.  Thus  in  reality,  the </p><p>description  of  the  time-space  continuum  by </p><p>means of Gauss co-ordinates completely replaces </p><p>the description with the aid of a body of reference, </p><p>without  suffering  from  the  defects  of  the  latter </p><p>mode  of  description;  it  is  not  tied  down  to  the </p><p>Euclidean  character  of  the  continuum  which  has </p><p>to be represented. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>XXVIII </p><p></p><p>EXACT  FORMULATION  OF  THE  GENERAL </p><p>PRINCIPLE  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>W </p><p></p><p>E  are  now  in  a  position  to  replace  the </p><p>  provisional  formulation  of  the  general </p><p>  principle  of  relativity  given  in  Section </p><p>XVIII  by  an  exact  formulation.

The  following </p><p>statement  corresponds  to  the  fundamental  idea </p><p>of  the  general  principle  of  relativity:  “All  Gaus-</p><p>sian co-ordinate systems are essentially equivalent </p><p>for the formulation of the general laws of nature.” </p><p>We can state this general principle of relativity </p><p>in  still  another  form,  which  renders  it  yet  more </p><p>clearly intelligible than it is when in the form of </p><p>115 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>116    GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>the  natural  extension  of  the  special  principle </p><p>of  relativity.  According  to  the  special  theory  of </p><p>relativity, the equations which express the general </p><p>laws  of  nature  pass  over  into  equations  of  the </p><p>same  form  when,  by  making  use  of  the  Lorentz </p><p>transformation, we replace the space-time variables </p><p>x, y, z, t, of a (Galileian) reference-body K by the </p><p>space-time variables x', y', z', t', of a new reference- </p><p>body  K'.  According  to  the  general  theory  of </p><p>relativity,  on  the  other  hand,  by  application  of </p><p>arbitrary  substitutions  of  the  Gauss  variables  x1, </p><p>x2,  x3,  x4,  the  equations  must  pass  over  into </p><p>equations  of  the  same  form;  for  every  transfor-</p><p>mation  (not  only  the  Lorentz  transformation) </p><p>corresponds to the transition of one Gauss co-ordi-</p><p>nate system into another.  </p><p></p><p>If we desire to adhere to our “old-time” three- </p><p>dimensional  view  of  things,  then  we  can  char-</p><p>acterise  the  development  which  is  being  under-</p><p>gone  by  the  fundamental  idea  of  the  general </p><p>theory of relativity as follows: The special theory </p><p>of  relativity  has  reference  to  Galileian  domains, </p><p>i.e. to those in which no gravitational field exists. </p><p>In  this  connection  a  Galileian  reference-body </p><p>serves  as  body  of  reference,  i.e. a  rigid  body  the </p><p>state  of  motion  of  which  is  so  chosen  that  the </p><p>Galileian  law  of  the  uniform  rectilinear  mo-</p><p>tion of “isolated” material points holds relatively </p><p>to it.  </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>GENERAL  PRINCIPLE  OF  RELATIVITY    117 </p><p></p><p>Certain  considerations  suggest  that  we  should </p><p>refer the same Galileian domains to non-Galileian </p><p>reference-bodies  also.  A  gravitational  field  of  a </p><p>special kind is then present  with respect to  these </p><p>bodies (cf. Sections XX and XXIII).  </p><p></p><p>In gravitational fields there are no such things </p><p>as  rigid  bodies  with  Euclidean  properties;  thus </p><p>the fictitious rigid body of reference is of no avail </p><p>in  the  general  theory  of  relativity.  The  motion </p><p>of clocks is also influenced by gravitational fields, </p><p>and  in  such  a  way  that  a  physical  definition  of </p><p>time which is made directly with the aid of clocks </p><p>has  by  no  means  the  same  degree  of  plausibility </p><p>as in the special theory of relativity.  </p><p></p><p>For  this  reason  non-rigid  reference-bodies  are </p><p>used which are as a whole not only moving in any </p><p>way whatsoever, but which also suffer alterations </p><p>in  form  ad  lib.  during  their  motion.  Clocks,  for </p><p>which the law of motion is of any kind, however </p><p>irregular,  serve  for  the  definition  of  time.  We </p><p>have to imagine each of these clocks fixed at a point </p><p>on  the  non-rigid  reference-body.

This  non-rigid  refer-</p><p>ence-body,  which  might  appropriately  be  termed </p><p>a  “reference-mollusk,”  is  in  the  main  equivalent </p><p>to  a  Gaussian  four-dimensional  co-ordinate  sys- </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>118    GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>tem  chosen  arbitrarily.

Hereupon  we  introduce  a  hypothesis: </p><p>that  the  influence  of  the  gravitational  field  on </p><p>measuring-rods, clocks and freely-moving material </p><p>points  continues  to  take  place  according  to  the </p><p>same  laws,  even  in  the  case  when  the  prevailing </p><p>gravitational  field  is  not  derivable  from  the </p><p>Galileian  special  case,  simply  by  means  of  a </p><p>transformation of co-ordinates.  </p><p></p><p>The  next  step  is  to  investigate  the  space-time </p><p>behaviour of the gravitational field G, which was </p><p>derived from the Galileian special case simply by </p><p>transformation  of  the  co-ordinates.  This  be-</p><p>haviour  is  formulated  in  a  law,  which  is  always </p><p>valid, no matter how the reference-body (mollusk) </p><p>used in the description may be chosen.  </p><p></p><p>This law is not yet the general law of the gravita-</p><p>tional  field,  since  the  gravitational  field  under </p><p>consideration  is  of  a  special  kind.

Thus  the </p><p>latter theory is obtained here without any particu-</p><p>lar assumption, whereas Newton had to introduce </p><p>the hypothesis that the force of attraction between </p><p>mutually  attracting  material  points  is  inversely </p><p>proportional to the square of the distance between </p><p>them.  If  we  increase  the  accuracy  of  the  calcu-</p><p>lation,  deviations  from  the  theory  of  Newton </p><p>make  their  appearance,  practically  all  of  which </p><p>must  nevertheless  escape  the  test  of  observation </p><p>owing to their smallness.  </p><p></p><p>We  must  draw  attention  here  to  one  of  these </p><p>deviations.  According  to  Newton’s  theory,  a </p><p>planet  moves  round  the  sun  in  an  ellipse,  which </p><p>would  permanently  maintain  its  position  with </p><p>respect  to  the  fixed  stars,  if  we  could  disregard </p><p>the  motion  of  the  fixed  stars  themselves  and  the </p><p>action  of  the  other  planets  under  consideration. </p><p>Thus,  if  we  correct  the  observed  motion  of  the </p><p>planets for these two influences, and if Newton’s </p><p>theory  be  strictly  correct,  we  ought  to  obtain </p><p>for  the  orbit  of  the  planet  an  ellipse,  which  is </p><p>fixed  with  reference  to  the  fixed  stars.  This </p><p>deduction,  which  can  be  tested  with  great  ac-</p><p>curacy,  has  been  confirmed  for  all  the  planets </p><p>save  one,  with  the  precision  that  is  capable  of </p><p>being  obtained  by  the  delicacy  of  observation </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SOLUTION  OF  GRAVITATION           123 </p><p></p><p>attainable  at  the  present  time.  The  sole  ex-</p><p>ception is Mercury, the planet which lies nearest </p><p>the  sun.  Since  the  time  of  Leverrier,  it  has  been </p><p>known that the ellipse corresponding to the orbit </p><p>of  Mercury,  after  it  has  been  corrected  for  the </p><p>influences mentioned above, is not stationary with </p><p>respect  to  the  fixed  stars,  but  that  it  rotates  ex-</p><p>ceedingly  slowly  in the  plane of  the orbit  and in </p><p>the  sense  of  the  orbital  motion.  The  value  ob-</p><p>tained  for  this  rotary  movement  of  the  orbital </p><p>ellipse  was  43  seconds  of  arc  per  century,  an </p><p>amount  ensured  to  be  correct  to  within  a  few </p><p>seconds  of  arc.  This  effect  can  be  explained  by </p><p>means  of  classical  mechanics  only  on  the  as-</p><p>sumption  of  hypotheses  which  have  little  proba-</p><p>bility,  and  which  were  devised  solely  for  this </p><p>purpose.  </p><p></p><p>On the basis of the general theory of relativity, </p><p>it  is  found  that  the  ellipse  of  every  planet  round </p><p>the  sun  must  necessarily  rotate  in  the  manner </p><p>indicated  above;  that  for  all  the  planets,  with </p><p>the  exception  of  Mercury,  this  rotation  is  too </p><p>small  to  be  detected  with  the  delicacy  of  ob-</p><p>servation  possible  at  the  present  time;  but  that </p><p>in  the  case  of  Mercury  it  must  amount  to  43 </p><p>seconds of arc per century, a result which is strictly </p><p>in agreement with observation.  </p><p></p><p>Apart from this one, it has hitherto been possible </p><p>to  make  only  two  deductions  from  the  theory </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>124    GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>which admit of being tested by observation, to wit, </p><p>the  curvature  of  light  rays  by  the  gravitational </p><p>field of the sun,1 and a displacement of the spectral </p><p>lines of light reaching us from large stars, as com-</p><p>pared  with  the  corresponding  lines  for  light  pro-</p><p>duced  in  an  analogous  manner  terrestrially  (i.e. </p><p>by  the  same  kind  of  molecule *).

If  we  ponder  over  the  question  as  to </p><p>how the universe, considered as a whole, is to be </p><p>regarded,  the  first  answer  that  suggests  itself  to </p><p>us  is  surely  this:  As  regards  space  (and  time) </p><p>the  universe  is  infinite.  There  are  stars  every-</p><p>where,  so  that  the  density  of  matter,  although </p><p>very  variable  in  detail,  is  nevertheless  on  the </p><p>average  everywhere  the  same.  In  other  words: </p><p>However  far  we  might  travel  through  space,  we </p><p>should  find  everywhere  an  attenuated  swarm  of </p><p>fixed  stars  of  approximately  the  same  kind  and </p><p>density. </p><p></p><p>125 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>126    CONSIDERATIONS  ON  THE  UNIVERSE </p><p></p><p>This view is not in harmony with the theory of </p><p>Newton.  The  latter  theory  rather  requires  that </p><p>the universe should have a kind of centre in which </p><p>the  density  of  the  stars  is  a  maximum,  and  that </p><p>as  we  proceed  outwards  from  this  centre  the </p><p>group-density  of  the  stars  should  diminish,  until </p><p>finally,  at  great  distances,  it  is  succeeded  by  an </p><p>infinite  region  of  emptiness.  The  stellar  universe </p><p>ought to be a finite island in the infinite ocean of </p><p>space.1  </p><p></p><p>This conception is in itself not very satisfactory. </p><p>It  is  still  less  satisfactory  because  it  leads  to  the </p><p>result  that  the  light  emitted  by  the stars  and  also </p><p>individual  stars  of  the  stellar  system  are  per-</p><p>petually  passing  out  into  infinite  space,  never </p><p>to  return,  and  without  ever  again  coming  into </p><p>interaction  with  other  objects  of  nature.  Such </p><p>a  finite  material  universe  would  be  destined </p><p>to  become  gradually  but  systematically  impov-</p><p>erished. </p><p></p><p>0</p><p></p><p>r</p><p></p><p>1 Proof. — According  to  the  theory  of  Newton,  the  number  of </p><p>“lines  of  force”  which  come  from  infinity  and  terminate  in  a  mass </p><p>m is proportional to the mass m.  If, on the average, the mass-den-</p><p>sity </p><p> is constant throughout the universe, then a sphere of volume </p><p>V  will  enclose  the  average  mass </p><p>.</p><p>  Thus  the  number  of  lines  of </p><p>force  passing  through  the  surface  F  of  the  sphere  into  its  interior  is </p><p>proportional  to </p><p>  For  unit  area  of  the  surface  of  the  sphere  the </p><p>number of lines of force which enters the sphere is thus proportional </p><p></p><p>0Vr</p><p></p><p>0Vr</p><p></p><p>.</p><p></p><p>to </p><p></p><p>r</p><p></p><p>0</p><p></p><p>V</p><p>F</p><p></p><p>* or </p><p></p><p>0Rr</p><p>.</p><p></p><p> Hence the intensity of the field at the surface would </p><p></p><p>ultimately  become  infinite  with  increasing  radius  R  of  the  sphere, </p><p>which is impossible. </p><p></p><p>[*</p><p></p><p>r — J.M.] </p><p></p><p>0</p><p></p><p>v</p><p>F</p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>NEWTON’S  THEORY                    127 </p><p></p><p>In order to escape  this dilemma,  Seeliger sug-</p><p>gested a modification of Newton’s law, in which </p><p>he  assumes  that  for  great  distances  the  force  of </p><p>attraction  between  two  masses  diminishes  more </p><p>rapidly than would result from the inverse square </p><p>law.  In  this  way  it  is  possible  for  the  mean </p><p>density of matter to be constant everywhere, even </p><p>to  infinity,  without  infinitely  large  gravitational </p><p>fields  being  produced.  We  thus  free  ourselves </p><p>from  the  distasteful  conception  that  the  material </p><p>universe ought to possess something of the nature </p><p>of a centre.

The  development  of  non-Euclidean </p><p>geometry  led  to  the  recognition  of  the  fact, </p><p>that  we  can  cast  doubt  on  the  infiniteness  of </p><p>our  space  without  coming  into  conflict  with  the </p><p>laws  of  thought  or  with  experience  (Riemann, </p><p>Helmholtz).  These  questions  have  already  been </p><p>treated  in  detail  and  with  unsurpassable  lucidity </p><p>by  Helmholtz  and  Poincaré,  whereas  I  can  only </p><p>touch on them briefly here.  </p><p></p><p>In  the  first  place,  we  imagine  an  existence  in </p><p>two-dimensional  space.  Flat  beings  with  flat </p><p>implements, and in particular flat rigid measuring- </p><p>rods,  are  free  to  move  in  a  plane.  For  them </p><p>nothing  exists  outside  of  this  plane:  that  which </p><p>they observe to happen to themselves and to their </p><p>flat  “things”  is  the  all-inclusive  reality  of  their </p><p>plane.

In  contrast  to  ours, </p><p>the  universe  of  these  beings  is  two-dimensional; </p><p>but,  like  ours,  it  extends  to  infinity.  In  their </p><p>universe  there  is  room  for  an  infinite  number  of </p><p>identical squares made up of rods, i.e. its volume </p><p>(surface)  is  infinite.  If  these  beings  say  their </p><p>universe  is  “plane,”  there  is  sense  in  the  state-</p><p>ment,  because  they  mean  that  they  can  perform </p><p>the  constructions  of  plane  Euclidean  geometry </p><p>with  their  rods.  In  this  connection  the  indi-</p><p>vidual  rods  always  represent  the  same  distance, </p><p>independently of their position.  </p><p></p><p>Let us consider now a second two-dimensional </p><p>existence,  but  this  time  on  a  spherical  surface </p><p>instead  of  on  a  plane.  The  flat  beings  with  their </p><p>measuring-rods  and  other  objects  fit  exactly  on </p><p>this surface and they are unable to leave it. Their </p><p>whole universe of observation extends exclusively </p><p>over  the  surface  of  the  sphere.  Are  these  beings </p><p>able  to  regard  the  geometry  of  their  universe  as </p><p>being  plane  geometry  and  their  rods  withal  as </p><p>the  realisation  of  “distance”?  They  cannot  do </p><p>this.  For  if  they  attempt  to  realise  a  straight </p><p>line,  they  will  obtain  a  curve,  which  we  “three- </p><p>dimensional  beings”  designate  as  a  great  circle, </p><p>i.e.  a  self-contained  line of  definite  finite  length, </p><p>which can be measured up by means of a measur-</p><p>ing-rod.  Similarly,  this  universe  has  a  finite </p><p>area,  that  can  be  compared  with  the  area  of  a </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>130    CONSIDERATIONS  ON  THE  UNIVERSE </p><p></p><p>square  constructed  with  rods.  The  great  charm </p><p>resulting  from  this  consideration  lies  in  the </p><p>recognition  of  the  fact  that  the  universe  of  these </p><p>beings is finite and yet has no limits.  </p><p></p><p>But  the  spherical-surface  beings  do  not  need </p><p>to go on a world-tour in order to perceive that they </p><p>are  not  living  in  a  Euclidean  universe.  They  can </p><p>convince themselves of this on every part of their </p><p>“world,”  provided  they  do  not  use  too  small  a </p><p>piece  of  it.  Starting  from  a  point,  they  draw </p><p>“straight  lines”  (arcs  of  circles  as  judged  in </p><p>three-dimensional  space)  of  equal  length  in  all </p><p>directions.  They  will  call  the  line  joining  the </p><p>free  ends  of  these  lines  a  “circle.”  For  a  plane </p><p>surface, the ratio of the circumference of a circle </p><p>to its diameter, both lengths being measured with </p><p>the same rod, is, according to Euclidean geometry </p><p>of the plane, equal to a constant value p , which is </p><p>independent  of  the  diameter  of  the  circle.  On </p><p>their spherical surface our flat beings would find </p><p>for this ratio the value </p><p></p><p>,</p><p></p><p>)(</p><p>r</p><p>sin</p><p>R</p><p>r</p><p>)(</p><p>R</p><p>i.e.  a  smaller  value  than  p ,  the  difference  being </p><p>the  more  considerable,  the  greater  is  the  radius </p><p>of  the  circle  in  comparison  with  the  radius  R  of </p><p>the  “world-sphere.”  By  means  of  this  relation </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>p</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>UNIVERSE — FINITE  YET  UNBOUNDED    131 </p><p></p><p>the  spherical  beings  can  determine  the  radius  of </p><p>their  universe  (“world”),  even  when  only  a </p><p>relatively  small  part  of  their  world-sphere  is </p><p>available  for  their  measurements.  But  if  this </p><p>part  is  very  small  indeed,  they  will  no  longer  be </p><p>able  to  demonstrate  that  they  are  on  a  spherical </p><p>“world”  and  not  on  a  Euclidean  plane,  for  a </p><p>small part of a spherical surface differs only slightly </p><p>from a piece of a plane of the same size. </p><p></p><p>Thus  if  the  spherical-surface  beings  are  living </p><p>on  a  planet  of  which  the  solar  system  occupies </p><p>only  a  negligibly  small  part  of  the  spherical </p><p>universe,  they  have  no  means  of  determining </p><p>whether they are living in a finite or in an infinite </p><p>universe,  because  the  “piece  of  universe”  to </p><p>which  they  have  access  is  in  both  cases  prac-</p><p>tically  plane,  or  Euclidean.  It  follows  directly </p><p>from  this  discussion,  that  for  our  sphere-beings </p><p>the  circumference  of  a  circle  first  increases  with </p><p>the  radius  until  the  “circumference  of  the  uni-</p><p>verse”  is  reached,  and  that  it  thenceforward </p><p>gradually  decreases  to  zero  for  still  further  in-</p><p>creasing values of the radius. During this process </p><p>the  area  of  the  circle  continues  to  increase  more </p><p>and  more,  until  finally  it  becomes  equal  to  the </p><p>total area of the whole “world-sphere.”  </p><p></p><p>Perhaps  the  reader  will  wonder  why  we  have </p><p>placed  our  “beings”  on  a  sphere  rather  than  on </p><p>another  closed  surface.  But  this  choice  has  its </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>132    CONSIDERATIONS  ON  THE  UNIVERSE </p><p></p><p>justification  in  the  fact  that,  of  all  closed  sur-</p><p>faces,  the  sphere  is  unique  in  possessing  the </p><p>property  that  all  points  on  it  are  equivalent.  I </p><p>admit  that  the  ratio  of  the  circumference  c  of  a </p><p>circle to its radius r depends on r, but for a given </p><p>value  of  r  it  is  the  same  for  all  points  of  the </p><p>“world-sphere”;  in  other  words,  the  “world- </p><p>sphere” is a “surface of constant curvature.”  </p><p></p><p>To  this  two-dimensional sphere-universe  there </p><p>is  a  three-dimensional  analogy,  namely,  the </p><p>three-dimensional spherical space which was dis-</p><p>covered  by  Riemann.  Its  points  are  likewise  all </p><p>equivalent.  It  possesses  a  finite  volume,  which </p><p>is  determined  by  its  “radius”  (</p><p>).  Is  it  pos-</p><p>sible  to  imagine  a  spherical  space?  To  imagine </p><p>a space means nothing else than that we imagine </p><p>an  epitome  of  our  “space”  experience,  i.e.  of </p><p>experience that we can have in the movement of </p><p>“rigid”  bodies.  In  this  sense  we  can  imagine </p><p>a spherical space.  </p><p></p><p>22 Rp</p><p></p><p>3</p><p></p><p>Suppose we draw lines or stretch strings in all </p><p>directions  from  a  point,  and  mark  off  from  each </p><p>of  these  the  distance  r  with  a  measuring-rod. </p><p>All  the  free  end-points  of  these  lengths  lie  on  a </p><p>spherical  surface.  We  can  specially  measure  up </p><p>the area (F) of this surface by means of a square </p><p>made  up  of  measuring-rods.  If  the  universe  is </p><p>Euclidean,  then </p><p>;  if  it  is  spherical,  then </p><p>F is always less than </p><p>.

At first, the straight </p><p>lines which radiate from the starting point diverge </p><p>farther  and  farther  from  one  another,  but  later </p><p>they  approach  each  other,  and  finally  they  run </p><p>together  again  at  a  “counter-point”  to  the  start-</p><p>ing  point.  Under  such  conditions  they  have </p><p>traversed  the  whole  spherical  space.  It  is  easily </p><p>seen  that  the  three-dimensional  spherical  space </p><p>is quite analogous to the two-dimensional spherical </p><p>surface.  It  is  finite  (i.e.  of  finite  volume),  and </p><p>has no bounds.  </p><p></p><p>It  may  be  mentioned  that  there  is  yet  another </p><p>kind  of  curved  space:  “elliptical  space.”  It  can </p><p>be  regarded  as  a  curved  space  in  which  the  two </p><p>“counter-points”  are  identical  (indistinguishable </p><p>from  each  other).  An  elliptical universe  can  thus </p><p>be considered to some extent as a curved universe </p><p>possessing central symmetry.  </p><p></p><p>It follows from what has been said, that closed </p><p>spaces  without  limits  are  conceivable.  From </p><p>amongst  these,  the  spherical  space  (and  the  el-</p><p>liptical) excels in its simplicity, since all points on </p><p>it  are  equivalent.  As  a  result  of  this  discussion, </p><p>a most interesting question arises for astronomers </p><p>and  physicists,  and  that  is  whether  the  universe </p><p>in which we live is infinite, or whether it is finite </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>134    CONSIDERATIONS  ON  THE  UNIVERSE </p><p></p><p>in  the  manner  of  the  spherical  universe.  Our  ex-</p><p>perience is far from being sufficient to enable us </p><p>to  answer  this  question.  But  the  general  theory </p><p>of  relativity  permits  of  our  answering  it  with  a </p><p>moderate  degree  of  certainty,  and  in  this  con-</p><p>nection the difficulty mentioned in Section XXX </p><p>finds its solution.  </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>XXXII </p><p></p><p>THE  STRUCTURE  OF  SPACE  ACCORDING  TO </p><p>THE  GENERAL  THEORY  OF  RELATIVITY </p><p></p><p>A </p><p></p><p>CCORDING  to  the  general  theory  of </p><p>  relativity,  the  geometrical  properties  of </p><p>  space  are  not  independent,  but  they  are </p><p>determined  by  matter.  Thus  we  can  draw  con-</p><p>clusions  about  the  geometrical  structure  of  the </p><p>universe  only  if  we  base  our  considerations  on </p><p>the  state  of  the  matter  as  being  something  that </p><p>is  known.  We  know  from  experience  that,  for  a </p><p>suitably chosen co-ordinate system, the velocities </p><p>of  the  stars  are  small  as  compared  with  the </p><p>velocity  of  transmission  of  light.  We  can  thus </p><p>as  a  rough  approximation  arrive  at  a  conclusion </p><p>as  to  the  nature  of  the  universe  as  a  whole,  if </p><p>we treat the matter as being at rest.  </p><p></p><p>We already know from our previous discussion </p><p>that  the  behaviour  of  measuring-rods  and  clocks </p><p>is  influenced  by  gravitational  fields,  i.e.  by  the </p><p>distribution  of  matter.  This  in  itself  is  sufficient </p><p>to exclude the possibility of the exact validity of </p><p>Euclidean  geometry  in  our  universe.  But  it  is </p><p>conceivable that our universe differs only slightly </p><p>135 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>136    CONSIDERATIONS  ON  THE  UNIVERSE </p><p></p><p>from  a  Euclidean  one,  and  this  notion  seems  all </p><p>the  more  probable,  since  calculations  show  that </p><p>the  metrics  of  surrounding  space  is  influenced </p><p>only  to  an  exceedingly  small  extent  by  masses </p><p>even  of  the  magnitude  of  our  sun.  We  might </p><p>imagine  that,  as  regards  geometry,  our  universe </p><p>behaves  analogously  to  a  surface  which  is  ir-</p><p>regularly curved in its individual parts, but which </p><p>nowhere departs appreciably from a plane: some-</p><p>thing  like  the  rippled  surface  of  a  lake.  Such  a </p><p>universe  might  fittingly  be  called  a  quasi-Eu-</p><p>clidean  universe.  As  regards  its  space  it  would </p><p>be  infinite.  But  calculation  shows  that  in  a </p><p>quasi-Euclidean  universe  the  average  density  of </p><p>matter  would  necessarily  be  nil.  Thus  such  a </p><p>universe could not be inhabited by  matter every-</p><p>where;  it  would  present  to  us  that  unsatisfactory </p><p>picture which we portrayed in Section XXX.  </p><p></p><p>If  we  are  to  have  in  the  universe  an  average </p><p>density  of  matter  which  differs  from  zero,  how-</p><p>ever  small  may  be  that  difference,  then  the </p><p>universe  cannot  be  quasi-Euclidean.  On  the  con-</p><p>trary,  the  results  of  calculation  indicate  that  if </p><p>matter  be  distributed  uniformly,  the  universe </p><p>would  necessarily  be  spherical  (or  elliptical). </p><p>Since in reality the detailed distribution of matter </p><p>is  not  uniform,  the  real  universe  will  deviate  in </p><p>individual  parts  from  the  spherical,  i.e.  the  uni-</p><p>verse  will  be  quasi-spherical.  But  it  will  be </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>THE  STRUCTURE  OF  SPACE            137 </p><p></p><p>necessarily  finite.  In  fact,  the  theory  supplies </p><p>us with a simple connection 1 between the space- </p><p>expanse  of  the  universe  and  the  average  density </p><p>of matter in it. </p><p></p><p>1 For  the  “radius”  R  of  the  universe  we  obtain  the  equation </p><p></p><p>2 =R</p><p></p><p>2</p><p>rk</p><p></p><p>The  use  of  the  C.G.S.  system  in  this  equation  gives</p><p></p><p>=</p><p></p><p>08.1</p><p></p><p>2710</p><p></p><p>; </p><p></p><p>2</p><p>k</p><p></p><p>r</p><p></p><p> is the average density of the matter. </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>(cid:215)</p><p></p><p></p><p>A P P E N D I X   I </p><p></p><p>SIMPLE  DERIVATION  OF  THE  LORENTZ </p><p>TRANSFORMATION  [SUPPLEMENTARY  TO  SEC-</p><p>TION  XI] </p><p></p><p>F </p><p></p><p>OR  the  relative  orientation  of  the  co-ordi-</p><p>  nate   systems   indicated   in   Fig.   2,   the  </p><p>  x-axes  of  both  systems  permanently  co-</p><p>incide.

Theories  are </p><p>evolved,  and  are  expressed  in  short  compass  as </p><p>statements  of  a  large  number  of  individual  ob-</p><p>servations  in  the  form  of  empirical  laws,  from </p><p>which  the  general  laws  can  be  ascertained  by </p><p>comparison.  Regarded  in  this  way,  the  develop-</p><p>ment of a science bears some resemblance to the </p><p>compilation  of  a  classified  catalogue.  It  is,  as </p><p>it were, a purely empirical enterprise.  </p><p></p><p>But  this  point  of  view  by  no  means  embraces </p><p>the  whole  of  the  actual  process;  for  it  slurs  over </p><p>the  important  part  played  by </p><p>intuition  and </p><p>deductive  thought  in  the  development  of  an </p><p>exact science. As soon as a science has emerged </p><p>from  its  initial  stages,  theoretical  advances  are </p><p>no longer achieved merely by a process of arrange-</p><p>ment.  Guided  by  empirical  data,  the  investigator </p><p>rather  develops  a  system  of  thought  which,  in </p><p>148 </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>EXPERIMENTAL  CONFIRMATION       149 </p><p></p><p>general, is built up logically from a small number </p><p>of fundamental assumptions, the so-called axioms. </p><p>We  call  such  a  system  of  thought  a  theory.  The </p><p>theory  finds  the  justification  for  its  existence  in </p><p>the fact that it correlates a large number of single </p><p>observations,  and  it  is  just  here  that  the  “truth” </p><p>of the theory lies.  </p><p></p><p>Corresponding to the same complex of empirical </p><p>data,  there  may  be  several  theories,  which  differ </p><p>from  one  another  to  a  considerable  extent.  But </p><p>as regards the deductions from the theories which </p><p>are  capable  of  being  tested,  the  agreement  be-</p><p>tween  the  theories  may  be  so  complete,  that  it </p><p>becomes difficult to find such deductions in which </p><p>the  two  theories  differ  from  each  other.  As  an </p><p>example, a case of general interest is available in </p><p>the province of biology, in the Darwinian theory </p><p>of  the  development  of  species  by  selection  in </p><p>the  struggle  for  existence,  and  in  the  theory  of </p><p>development  which  is  based  on  the  hypothesis </p><p>of  the  hereditary  transmission  of  acquired  char-</p><p>acters.  </p><p></p><p>We  have  another  instance  of  far-reaching </p><p>agreement  between  the  deductions  from  two </p><p>theories in Newtonian mechanics on the one hand, </p><p>and  the  general  theory  of  relativity  on  the  other. </p><p>This agreement goes so far, that up to the present </p><p>we have been able to find only a few deductions </p><p>from  the  general  theory  of  relativity  which  are </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>150                           APPENDIX  III </p><p></p><p>capable of investigation, and to which the physics </p><p>of  pre-relativity  days  does  not  also  lead,  and </p><p>this despite the profound difference in the funda-</p><p>mental  assumptions  of  the  two  theories.  In </p><p>what  follows,  we  shall  again  consider  these  im-</p><p>portant  deductions,  and  we  shall  also  discuss </p><p>the  empirical  evidence  appertaining  to  them </p><p>which has hitherto been obtained.  </p><p></p><p>(a) MOTION  OF  THE  PERIHELION  OF  MERCURY </p><p></p><p>According  to  Newtonian  mechanics  and  New-</p><p>ton’s law of gravitation, a planet which is revolving </p><p>round the sun would describe an ellipse round the </p><p>latter,  or,  more  correctly,  round  the  common </p><p>centre  of  gravity  of  the  sun  and  the  planet.  In </p><p>such a system, the sun, or the common centre of </p><p>gravity, lies in one of the foci of the orbital ellipse </p><p>in  such  a  manner  that,  in  the  course  of  a  planet- </p><p>year, the distance sun-planet grows from  a  mini-</p><p>mum  to  a  maximum,  and  then  decreases  again </p><p>to  a  minimum.  If  instead  of  Newton’s  law  we </p><p>insert a somewhat different law of attraction into </p><p>the  calculation,  we  find  that,  according  to  this </p><p>new law, the motion would still take place in such </p><p>a  manner  that  the  distance  sun-planet  exhibits </p><p>periodic  variations;  but  in  this  case  the  angle </p><p>described  by  the  line  joining  sun  and  planet </p><p>during  such  a  period  (from  perihelion — closest </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>EXPERIMENTAL  CONFIRMATION       151 </p><p></p><p>proximity  to  the  sun — to  perihelion)  would </p><p>differ from 360°. The line of the orbit would not </p><p>then  be  a  closed  one,  but  in  the  course  of  time </p><p>it  would  fill  up  an  annular  part  of  the  orbital </p><p>plane,  viz.  between  the  circle  of  least  and  the </p><p>circle  of  greatest  distance  of  the  planet  from </p><p>the sun.  </p><p></p><p>According also to the general theory of relativity, </p><p>which differs of course from the theory of Newton, </p><p>a  small  variation  from  the  Newton-Kepler  mo-</p><p>tion of a planet in its orbit should take place, and </p><p>in  such  a  way,  that  the  angle  described  by  the </p><p>radius sun-planet between one perihelion and the </p><p>next  should  exceed  that  corresponding  to  one </p><p>complete revolution by an amount given by </p><p></p><p>+</p><p></p><p>24</p><p>22</p><p>cT</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>3</p><p></p><p>a</p><p></p><p>.</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p>)</p><p></p><p>e</p><p></p><p>(</p><p>1</p><p>(N.B. — One  complete  revolution  corresponds </p><p>to  the  angle  2 p   in  the  absolute  angular  measure </p><p>customary  in  physics,  and  the  above  expression </p><p>gives  the amount  by  which the  radius  sun-planet </p><p>exceeds  this  angle  during  the  interval  between </p><p>one  perihelion  and  the  next.)

Theory </p><p>requires  that  this  rotation  should  amount  to  43 </p><p>seconds of arc per century for the planet Mercury, </p><p>but  for  the  other  planets  of  our  solar  system  its </p><p>magnitude  should  be  so  small  that  it  would </p><p>necessarily escape detection.1 </p><p></p><p>In  point  of  fact,  astronomers  have  found  that </p><p>the  theory  of  Newton  does  not  suffice  to  cal-</p><p>culate  the  observed  motion  of  Mercury  with  an </p><p>exactness  corresponding  to  that  of  the  delicacy </p><p>of  observation  attainable  at  the  present  time. </p><p>After  taking  account  of  all  the  disturbing  in-</p><p>fluences  exerted  on  Mercury  by  the  remaining </p><p>planets,  it  was  found  (Leverrier — 1859 — and </p><p>Newcomb — 1895) that an unexplained perihelial </p><p>movement of the orbit of Mercury remained over, </p><p>the amount of which does not differ sensibly from </p><p>the  above-mentioned  + 43  seconds  of  arc  per </p><p>century.  The  uncertainty  of  the  empirical  result </p><p>amounts to a few seconds only.  </p><p></p><p>(b) DEFLECTION  OF  LIGHT  BY  A </p><p>GRAVITATIONAL  FIELD </p><p></p><p>In Section XXII it has been already mentioned </p><p>that, according to the general theory of relativity, </p><p>a  ray  of  light  will  experience  a  curvature  of  its </p><p>1 Especially  since  the  next  planet  Venus  has  an  orbit  that  is </p><p>almost  an  exact  circle,  which  makes  it  more  difficult  to  locate  the </p><p>perihelion with precision. </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>EXPERIMENTAL  CONFIRMATION       153 </p><p></p><p>path  when  passing  through  a  gravitational  field, </p><p>this  curvature  being  similar  to  that  experienced </p><p>by the path of a body which is projected through </p><p>a  gravitational  field.  As  a  result  of  this  theory, </p><p>we  should  expect  that  a  ray  of  light  which  is </p><p>passing close to a heavenly body would be deviated </p><p>towards  the  latter.  For  a  ray  of  light  which </p><p>passes  the  sun  at  a  distance  of  D</p><p>  sun-radii  from </p><p>its  centre,  the  angle  of  deflection  (a )  should </p><p>amount to </p><p></p><p>.</p><p> 71</p><p></p><p>seconds</p><p></p><p>arc of </p><p></p><p>=a</p><p></p><p>.</p><p></p><p>It  may  be  added  that,  according  to  the  theory, </p><p>half  of  this  deflection  is  produced  by  the  New-</p><p>tonian  field  of  attraction  of  the </p><p>sun,  and  the  other  half  by  the </p><p>geometrical modification (“curva-</p><p>ture”) of space caused by the sun. </p><p>This result admits of an experi-</p><p>mental  test  by  means  of  the </p><p>photographic registration of stars </p><p>during a total eclipse of the sun. </p><p>The  only  reason  why  we  must </p><p>wait for a total eclipse is because </p><p>at  every  other  time  the  atmos-</p><p>phere  is  so  strongly  illuminated </p><p>by  the  light  from  the  sun  that  the  stars  situated </p><p>near  the  sun’s  disc  are  invisible.

If  the  sun  (S)  were  not  present,  a  star </p><p>which  is  practically  infinitely  distant  would  be </p><p>seen  in  the  direction  D1,  as  observed  from  the </p><p>earth.  But  as  a  consequence  of  the  deflection  of </p><p>light  from  the  star  by  the  sun,  the  star  will  be </p><p>seen in the direction D2, i.e. at a somewhat greater </p><p>distance  from  the  centre  of  the  sun  than  corre-</p><p>sponds to its real position.  </p><p></p><p>In  practice,  the  question  is  tested  in  the  fol-</p><p>lowing  way.  The  stars  in  the  neighbourhood  of </p><p>the sun are photographed during a solar eclipse. </p><p>In  addition,  a  second  photograph  of  the  same </p><p>stars is taken when the sun is situated at another </p><p>position  in  the  sky,  i.e.  a  few  months  earlier  or </p><p>later. As compared with the standard photograph, </p><p>the positions of the stars on the eclipse-photograph </p><p>ought  to  appear  displaced  radially  outwards </p><p>(away  from  the  centre  of  the  sun)  by  an  amount </p><p>corresponding to the angle a .  </p><p></p><p>We  are  indebted  to  the  Royal  Society  and  to </p><p>the Royal Astronomical Society for the investiga-</p><p>tion  of  this  important  deduction.  Undaunted </p><p>by  the  war  and  by  difficulties  of  both  a  material </p><p>and  a  psychological  nature  aroused  by  the  war, </p><p>these  societies  equipped  two  expeditions — to </p><p>Sobral  (Brazil)  and  to  the  island  of  Principe </p><p>(West  Africa) — and  sent  several  of  Britain’s </p><p>most celebrated astronomers (Eddington, Cotting-</p><p>ham,  Crommelin,  Davidson),  in  order  to  obtain </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>EXPERIMENTAL  CONFIRMATION       155 </p><p></p><p>photographs  of  the  solar  eclipse  of  29th  May, </p><p>1919.  The  relative  discrepancies  to  be  expected </p><p>between  the  stellar  photographs  obtained  during </p><p>the  eclipse  and  the  comparison  photographs </p><p>amounted  to  a  few  hundredths  of  a  millimetre </p><p>only.  Thus  great  accuracy  was  necessary  in </p><p>making  the  adjustments  required  for  the  taking </p><p>of  the  photographs,  and  in  their  subsequent </p><p>measurement.  </p><p></p><p>The results of the measurements confirmed the </p><p>theory  in  a  thoroughly  satisfactory  manner.
